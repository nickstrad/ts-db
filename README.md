# Document DB MVP — TypeScript document API, SQLite storage, DuckDB queries

**Application authors write schemas and document operations, not SQL.** The platform captures document
operations as a small intermediate representation and compiles them to SQLite or DuckDB SQL. Regular
TypeScript control flow (the tic-tac-toe rules) still runs as TypeScript.

## Verification status

Item 27 audit on 2026-10-11, based on landed main `643b706`, on this 8 GB VM with Deno 2.9.5 and
`@duckdb/node-api` 1.5.6-r.1. These are dated observations, not standing guarantees.

| `PROP_SEED=20261010 deno task test:prop`               | PASS: 79 passed, 0 failed; explicit default-seed replay (2m20s).                                                                             |

The older Node run in `tests/CORE_TEST_RESULTS.txt` is historical. Earlier full unit runs sometimes exited 139
in a native DuckDB worker; item 27 records its actual results below rather than borrowing those counts. Real
S3 cases are not executed: no endpoint/credentials were supplied; the optional backup test is ignored.

Operational examples in this README and [SKIM.md](SKIM.md) (serve, demo, backup curl, restore and alternate
server configurations) are **not executed individually in item 27**: they need a managed, long-lived server
and operator-selected files/tokens. The integration and E2E harnesses exercise their underlying paths in
isolated scratch environments. Performance tasks are **not executed here**: latency thresholds depend on host
capacity and this VM is shared with other builders. See [perf/README.md](perf/README.md).

Command audit for the read-only [observability guide](docs/observability.md): `logs:ingest`, `logs:list`,
`logs:sweep` (including `--dry-run`) and its concrete `logs:query` examples are executed against an empty
scratch event log in item 27 (all exit 0; successful execution with no rows is not evidence of real traffic).
The placeholder query syntax (`<name>`, `[--param ...]`) is a usage template, not an executable command. Its
`TRACE_SQL=true bash ... perf:mixed my-run` example is **not executed** because it runs shared-host load
thresholds; its curl and jq trace pipeline are **not executed** because `$BASE_URL` and a managed
authenticated server are operator inputs. Its `perf:ingest` example is **not executed** because no fresh k6
raw-output artifact is produced by this audit. Integration/E2E verify trace and analysis paths; the k6 join
also has fixture coverage. No live load-performance claim follows from that coverage.

| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/schema.ts`      | The developer's schema builder: typed fields and indexes.                                    |
| `app/functions.ts`   | All application code: create/move/delete mutations, reads, grouped statistics. No SQL.       |
| `sdk/db.ts`          | Document operations become an engine-neutral query plan.                                     |

| `platform/sqlite.ts` | Per-app mutation serialization and SQLite transactions, including mutation-internal reads.   |
| `platform/duckdb.ts` | Read-only attachment of the same SQLite file; generated DuckDB queries.                      |
| `platform/server.ts` | Server entrypoint: scoped listener, backup and ingest-then-sweep timers, signal shutdown.    |
| `platform/layers.ts` | `PlatformLive`: the server's ordered layer chain (config, logging, per-app storage, reader). |
| `platform/http/`     | Router, auth, handlers, and the `X-Trace-Id` / span contract (`trace.ts`).                   |

`GENERATED_SQL.txt` shows actual compiler output for the two layouts and two dialects.
`deno task explain > GENERATED_SQL.txt` regenerates it without running either database engine.

## Effect services and layers

`core/` holds pure validation, plans, compilation/decoding, tagged errors and event policy. SDK terminal
operations return `Effect.Effect<_, DbError>`; application handlers compose them with `yield*`.
`platform/services.ts` declares service tags. `PlatformLive` in `platform/layers.ts` acquires Config, logging,
IdGen, ObjectStore/AppRegistry, scope-owned TenantRegistry, per-app Storage/Backups, then the ReaderClient
child. TenantRegistry connects lazily; off mode retains the existing app tokens/files. `Layer.provideMerge`
orders resource acquisition and finalization. Shutdown drains HTTP, stops timers, closes the reader and SQLite
handles, then emits the final lifecycle record and drains logging.

The reader has a separate root in `platform/reader_layers.ts`: Config, reader logging, IdGen and
EventLogIngest. `makeAnalysis` shares the event-log instance for live analysis after ingest. App query readers
are scoped independently. Writer and reader retain separate native module graphs.

With tenancy enabled, credentials resolve request-local `TenantContext`; client tenant selectors are ignored.
`TenantStorageRouter` uses `LocalFolderRouter` to prepare validated per-tenant SQLite locations. Each app
builds a router over the configured tenant directory; trusted tenant id/path travels in reader IPC. Each
tenant has one schema-guarded file, so incompatible layouts need distinct tenants (as in E2E), or separate
deployments with separate TENANTS_DIR values. Tenant-mode readers are scoped per request; legacy mode uses the
app reader pool. Postgres holds tenants, hashed API keys, users, sessions and memberships, not application
documents. See [platform/auth/README.md](platform/auth/README.md).

## Tasks

Task names below are invoked as `deno task NAME`. Standalone steps of `ci` are executed by that task.
Operational tasks marked not executed have the reasons in Verification status above.

## Errors and HTTP statuses

`core/errors.ts:toHttpStatus` is exhaustive. Startup `ConfigError`/`SchemaDriftError` stop layer construction;
CLI and client errors are not served by this table.

The Effect port deliberately changes stale-version conflicts from blanket 400 to **409**, and queue saturation
to **503**. An overlapping backup is also 409; oversized bodies are 413. A mutation client should refresh
state after a conflict; retries after load shedding still need application-level idempotency.

## Minimum process model

```text
TypeScript client / browser
     |
     | named handler + JSON args (never raw SQL)
     v
Deno process 1: HTTP API + SQLite mutation handlers + backup and ingest-then-sweep timers
     |                  |
     | write/read tx    | JSON-lines RPC over stdin/stdout (query, ping, ingest)
     v                  v
app.sqlite <------ Deno process 2: query handlers + DuckDB SQLite extension
     |                  |
     | consistent       | JSONL logs -> event-log DuckDB file (derived; reader only)
     | VACUUM INTO      v
     v              <DATA_DIR>/eventlog.duckdb
local snapshot -> S3-compatible object store
```

Both long-lived processes run on **the same machine with the same local filesystem**. The server starts the
reader automatically. The two demo app IDs share these processes but have independent files. App data has no
second copy: no CDC pipeline, no replica-copy refresh loop, and no extra backup daemon. The only persistent
DuckDB file is the **derived** event-log file written by the reader's ingest from the JSONL logs
(`EVENTLOG_DUCKDB`, default `<DATA_DIR>/eventlog.duckdb`); the server never opens it. See "Observability and
the event log" below.

SQLite writes use `node:sqlite`. DuckDB uses its SQLite extension to read the live file. The processes are
separated because DuckDB documents a warning about linking multiple SQLite-library copies into one
application. Deno Workers/threads are not substituted for that OS-process boundary.

## Run

Use a recent Deno 2 runtime (Deno 2.2+ includes `node:sqlite`; a current Deno 2 release is the intended
target). The native DuckDB npm module needs local `node_modules` plus FFI permission. `nodeModulesDir: auto`
and the local demo's `-A` cover those requirements. Dependencies and the DuckDB `sqlite` extension need
network access on first use. This is native Deno, not a browser-WASM example or an edge-runtime deployment.

From this directory:

```sh
# Terminal 1. Also starts the DuckDB reader process.
TRACE_SQL=1 deno task serve

# Terminal 2. Runs a complete game using the typed HTTP client.
deno task demo

# Same application API and handlers, independent app, all-JSON physical layout.
deno task demo tic-tac-toe-json

# Inspect compiler output without database drivers.
deno task explain > GENERATED_SQL.txt

# Core tests, API type checks, then the real multi-process integration test.
deno task test
deno task check
deno task integration
```

The service binds to `127.0.0.1:8000`. Default app/admin tokens are `dev-only`, deliberately unsuitable for
deployment. Set `PORT`, `DATA_DIR`, `COLUMN_APP_TOKEN`, `JSON_APP_TOKEN`, and `ADMIN_TOKEN` as needed. Do not
expose this service to untrusted users. `TRACE_SQL=1` logs every compiled SQL statement at `info`; bound
application values are included only when `LOG_INCLUDE_BIND_VALUES` is also set.

## App-facing client

```ts
import { createClient } from "./sdk/client.ts";
import type { functions } from "./app/functions.ts";

const client = createClient<typeof functions>(
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
  "tic-tac-toe",
  "dev-only",
);
const { gameId } = await client.mutation("createGame", {
  xPlayer: "alice",
  oPlayer: "bob",
});
const game = await client.query("getGame", { gameId });
await client.mutation("makeMove", {
  gameId,
  playerId: "alice",
  cell: 0,
  expectedVersion: game!._version,
});
const stats = await client.query("winsByMark", {});
```

`import type` does not send server handlers or database libraries to the client. Handler names, argument
types, and result types are inferred. There is no code-generation step in this small example.

Every request carries an `X-Trace-Id`: the `traceId` argument to `client.query`/`client.mutation` if given,
otherwise a generated UUID. See "Trace propagation" below for what the server does with it.

## Query language and semantics

Supported: `get`, `find` with top-level scalar equality, chained `where`, numeric `gt`, `sort`, `limit`,
`collect`, `first`, `count`, `countBy`; and `insert`, `patch`, `delete` within mutations.

Inside a handler with `db` in scope:

```ts
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const games = yield* db.find("games", { status: "playing" })
    .sort("_creationTime", "desc").limit(20).collect();
  const wins = yield* db.find("games", { status: "won" }).countBy("winner");
  return { games, wins };
});
```

The first operation produces a plan such as:

```json
{
  "kind": "select",
  "table": "games",
  "filters": [{ "field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": "playing" }],
  "order": { "field": "_creationTime", "direction": "desc" },
  "limit": 20
}
```

Only platform code converts it to SQL. Identifiers are schema-validated, values use bound parameters, and
array predicates/unknown fields fail explicitly. This is not a compiler for arbitrary JavaScript closures,
MongoDB's entire query language, or Convex's full API. No hidden fetch-everything-and-filter-in-JavaScript
fallback is provided.

All fields are required unless explicitly nullable; there is no separate missing/undefined field state. Arrays
are validated recursively and stored as JSON text. Optional fields, nested-object schemas, joins, array
predicates, MongoDB operators, projection, cursors, and search are not implemented. Collection reads default
to 100 results and are capped at 1000. `count` counts all matching documents regardless of limit; `countBy`
groups all matches and caps returned groups. Sorting adds `_id` as a stable tie-breaker and spells out null
ordering.

`_id`, `_creationTime`, and `_version` are platform-owned metadata; each patch increments `_version`. Typed
clients cannot patch metadata. Arguments and writes also receive runtime validation.

### Number and text contracts

- **Numbers.** A `number` field is a JS double. In the columns layout it is a REAL column. In the json layout
  the document is stored as `JSON.stringify` text, which writes an integral double at or beyond 2^53 as
  integer text; SQLite's `json_extract` would read that back as an exact INTEGER rather than the double it
  denotes (item 30). The SQLite compiler therefore wraps a json-layout number read in `CAST(... AS REAL)`, so
  filters, ordering, `countBy` keys and index expressions agree with the columns layout and with DuckDB's
  DOUBLE cast. Integer, boolean, text and metadata reads are unchanged. Known gaps, pinned by
  `tests/unit/number_dialects_test.ts`: a database created before item 30 keeps its old bare `json_extract`
  index on a json-layout number field (results stay correct; drop and recreate the `idx_*` to use it again),
  and the DuckDB bind path throws for integral numbers with `|x| >= 2^63` in either layout.
- **Embedded NUL.** `node:sqlite` binds U+0000 intact but truncates TEXT at it on read, so an accepted string
  could commit and read back as a different value. Item 31 rejects it before commit (ADR 0005): a string or
  enum field value (at any array depth), a `get`/`patch`/`delete` id or a filter value containing U+0000 fails
  with `SchemaError { reason: "type-mismatch", expected: "text without U+0000" }`, and an `IdGen` id
  containing it fails as a `StorageError`. Nothing runs, so nothing is written. Reading a row that already
  holds NUL text (written before the contract) fails with a `StorageError` instead of returning a truncated
  value. Both layouts and both `Storage` implementations apply the same rules.

## Two physical layouts, same logical schema

`tic-tac-toe` uses columns. Strings/enums become TEXT, integers/booleans INTEGER, numbers REAL, and board
arrays JSON-encoded TEXT. Generated tables use SQLite STRICT mode.

`tic-tac-toe-json` uses `_id`, `_creationTime`, `_version`, and one `doc TEXT` JSON document per row. The same
schema validates the JSON. Index declarations compile to SQLite JSON expression indexes. This is JSON text,
not SQLite's binary JSONB encoding, so DuckDB can consume it as JSON text.

In columns mode, `status = "playing"` targets the `status` column. In JSON mode the SQLite compiler uses
`json_extract(doc, '$.status')`; the DuckDB compiler uses `json_extract_string(doc, '$.status')`.
Numeric/boolean extraction has explicit casts in the DuckDB dialect. The result decoder returns the same
TypeScript document shape in either layout and normalizes safe-integer BIGINT results to JS numbers.

Schema descriptors are stored in each file. Changing a schema or storage mode on an existing file fails
explicitly. There is no automatic migration or live schema reload.

## Transaction and consistency contract

A mutation gets one per-app queue slot and one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE ... COMMIT` transaction. Its `db.get` and
`db.find` calls execute through SQLite **inside the same transaction**. The board update and inserted move are
atomic. If validation or game logic throws, both roll back. Concurrent move attempts are serialized, and
`expectedVersion` rejects a stale client attempt.

Public `query` handlers execute in the DuckDB process and get a read-only document context. The attached
SQLite database is READ_ONLY. The worker serializes whole query handlers and scopes each handler to a fresh
transaction, so it does not intentionally reuse an earlier transaction snapshot across requests. The
integration test specifically checks read-after-write visibility on the real extension.

The mutation response returns the locally committed game immediately. DuckDB is never used to make
transactional write decisions. There is no second data copy that needs to catch up. This does not establish a
remotely replicated/linearizable database service; concurrent readers may legitimately see the state before an
overlapping write.

## Observability and the event log

Every process writes structured JSONL under `LOG_DIR/<role>/<date>/`. The reader owns ingest, retention and
live named analysis; the server reaches these through RPC and never imports DuckDB. The standalone `logs:*`
CLI opens the same derived file between reader writes. DuckDB permits one writer, so use the live admin
analysis route while the reader owns it. [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md) describes the schema,
catalog, parameters and worked examples; [perf/README.md](perf/README.md) describes k6 scenarios and the
loader into `k6_points`.

`LOG_LEVEL=info` is the default; `TRACE_SQL=true` or debug level enables SQL events. Bind values stay hidden
unless `LOG_INCLUDE_BIND_VALUES=true`. Logging uses a dropping queue (`EVENT_QUEUE_CAPACITY=10000`) and
batched flushes (`EVENT_FLUSH_MS=250`); shutdown drains the sink. Retention defaults to gzip after 7 days,
delete after 30 days, 1 GiB total JSONL, and 64 MiB rotation. `LOG_GZIP_AFTER_DAYS`, `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`,
`LOG_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` and `LOG_MAX_FILE_BYTES` control those limits. Only closed, settled, fully ingested
files with matching committed watermarks may be swept; today's files and pinned tails may exceed the cap.
Retention does not prune the derived DuckDB file. The hourly ingest-then-sweep timer and admin ingest RPC use
the same coordinator; dry-run plans from already committed state without writing.

### Trace propagation (item 34)

- **Ingress.** The server accepts the caller's `X-Trace-Id` when it is 1-128 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`.
  Anything else (absent, empty, too long, a space, a repeated header) is not an error: the request runs under
  a generated id. The id the request actually ran under is echoed in the response `X-Trace-Id` on every
  status.
- **Server fibers.** Each handler runs its whole dispatched Effect as a child span. The `http` event, the
  `handler` event (app invocations only: outcome `ok`, a typed failure, a defect or an interruption), the
  SQLite writer's `sql` and `tx` events (including rollback), backup phases and log records carry the trace
  id; handler-scoped ones also carry the handler's `spanId`.
- **Reader child.** `ReaderClient` captures the caller's trace when a call is submitted and writes it into
  that call's frame (`traceId`, a fresh `spanId`, the handler span as `parentSpanId`). The reader restores it
  as annotations, so its `sql`/`tx` events and logs share the trace id. Calls made outside any request (the
  startup ping, the ingest timer) send no trace properties and run under the reader's fallback
  `reader-<pid>-<requestId>`. A late reply to a timed-out call is logged under that call's trace.
- **k6 joins.** `perf/ingest_k6.ts` loads raw points into `k6_points`; `k6-vs-platform` compares overlapping
  time buckets with HTTP events. This is a bucket-level latency comparison, not a one-to-one request join.
- Tested end to end by `tests/unit/trace_e2e_test.ts` (real SDK, server and reader child).

### Runtime ingest and retention (items 32, 33, 35, 36)

- **Ingest.** The reader's `ingest` request runs the ingest-then-sweep coordinator against the persistent
  event-log file. The server never loads DuckDB: it sends the RPC every hour (first run one interval after
  startup) and on `POST /admin/logs/ingest` (admin token). The handle opens on the first ingest; a file that
  cannot be opened or has an incompatible schema fails that one RPC with `IngestError` and does not affect
  queries. The call shares `READER_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS`; a longer run is logged by the server as
  `ingest-sweep-failed` while the reader still commits.
- **Event schema v2.** Every typed event row carries `event_id` and joins exactly one `platform_events` row;
  `event_kind` is always the record's kind and `handler_kind` is the explicit query/mutation mapping; backup
  records carry `emitter`, `run_id` and `attempts` (ADR 0006). Ingest refuses an unversioned (v1) or foreign
  file; `upgradeEventLog` (`platform/eventlog/tables.ts`) rebuilds v1 from retained JSONL and is an explicit
  operator step with no CLI yet.
- **Retention follows ingest.** A JSONL file is gzipped or deleted only when it is closed (dated before today,
  not open, settled) and committed ingest accounts for all of it (ADR 0007). A file that fails the gate is
  kept, still counts toward `LOG_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`, and is reported as blocked. Nothing in the server or reader
  starts a retention sweep on its own; it runs only inside the ingest RPC.
- **Limits.** `LOG_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` bounds the JSONL tree only, and even there today's files and blocked files
  can exceed it. The derived DuckDB file is never pruned, so it grows without bound; the reply reports both
  budgets separately. Gzipped files are never re-ingested, so rebuilding the event log reconstructs only
  events whose JSONL is still retained. The DuckDB file is a derived cache: the JSONL is the source of truth.
  Server and reader must run in one timezone (they do, by inheriting one environment).

## Backups and restore

Manual backup, using the local object-store stand-in by default:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/backup/tic-tac-toe \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev-only'
```

For actual off-host backups, configure an S3-compatible bucket base URL and credentials on the server:

```sh
export S3_BASE_URL='https://YOUR_BUCKET.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
export AWS_REGION='us-east-1'
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='...'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='...'
# AWS_SESSION_TOKEN is supported for temporary credentials.
# For a compatible path-style service, base URL includes /bucket-name.

BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS=60000 deno task serve
```

The credentials need object GET/PUT permissions. They are server-side only. The signer does not implement a
cloud SDK credential-provider chain or automatic refresh of environment-supplied temporary credentials. Supply
renewed credentials/restart as appropriate for this demo.

The flow is
`VACUUM INTO new-file -> PRAGMA quick_check -> SHA-256 -> immutable snapshot PUT -> immutable manifest PUT -> latest manifest PUT`.
It does not copy the live SQLite main file while ignoring the WAL. Snapshot creation serializes with local
mutations; upload runs after releasing the mutation queue. There is one backup in progress per app and no
overlapping periodic backup sweep.

Snapshots live under `apps/<appId>/<timestamp>-<uuid>.sqlite`, with a manifest alongside each snapshot.
`apps/<appId>/latest.json` is published after successful snapshot upload. A failed upload does not advance the
latest manifest. Each snapshot contains an entire app, not one row or one table.

To restore, **stop the service and restore to a new path**, without an existing database/WAL/SHM there. The
command reads `latest.json`, verifies the hash and integrity, and creates the destination without overwriting
an existing database. Run it with the same object-store environment as the server:

```sh
deno task restore tic-tac-toe ./restored-data/tic-tac-toe.sqlite
# Restore the other app separately if needed, then start with:
DATA_DIR=./restored-data deno task serve
```

The restore publishes a complete temporary file with a same-filesystem hard link. It is an offline operation,
not an automatic live-database replacement. Server startup does not automatically restore absent files; absent
app files are initialized empty.

**This is asynchronous backup, not high availability.** A successful mutation acknowledges local SQLite
commit, not S3 durability. A host loss can lose commits newer than the last completed snapshot. Backup
intervals do not guarantee a fixed RPO during upload delays or failures. There is no leader election,
replicated WAL, failover, incremental upload, snapshot retention policy, or live restore. (Log retention is
separate; see "Observability and the event log".) Full snapshots read the entire database into memory before
upload; replace that path before using large databases. Local `object-store/` is not off-host redundancy.

## Configuration

The mechanically mirrored options table still carries MT-02’s historical “reserved” description; `api-key` and
`better-auth` are now implemented as described above. `DATABASE_URL` may also be used by admin tenant
operations in off mode because the registry is acquired lazily.

`platform/config.ts` is the single env boundary: `ConfigLive` reads every option below once, at layer
construction, and fails with a typed `ConfigError` rather than at first use. Every option is declared exactly
once, in `platform/config.ts`'s options table — this section is checked against that table mechanically
(`tests/unit/config_test.ts`), so it always lists the current platform version's options. Empty-string env
values are treated the same as unset. `ConfigTest(overrides)` ignores the environment entirely and is for
tests.

## Deliberate limits

This is a local, trusted-application prototype. Two database files are not a hostile-tenant security sandbox.
Handlers are statically registered modules; uploaded code execution, per-tenant process isolation, deployment
tooling, row-level authorization, and secret isolation are not implemented. Better Auth provides headless
email/password sessions and single-tenant membership resolution. `playerId` is supplied by the demo caller,
not verified identity. App-level shared bearer tokens are only a basic routing/access check. Client mutations
have no automatic retry or idempotency key, so a network timeout can leave an unknown commit outcome.

Legacy mode uses one writer connection per app; tenancy leases writers from a bounded per-app handle cache.
Both use one shared serial reader process. This demonstrates the design without establishing capacity.
SQLite's synchronous API and snapshot creation can block the API event loop. There are queue-size and
result-size caps but no complete deadline/cancellation, overload, restart, or resource-governance policy.
Avoid network I/O or long-running work inside mutation handlers. All long-lived processes must remain on one
local filesystem; object storage is a backup target, not a mounted live SQLite volume.

Reactive subscriptions, automatic dependency tracking, optimistic UI, durable actions/jobs, automatic
application-schema migrations, a complete production authentication policy, and a full query optimizer are not
included. Routing all reads through DuckDB demonstrates the requested architecture; it is not a claim that
this is faster than SQLite indexed point reads. In a later design, the platform could select SQLite for
transactional point reads and DuckDB for analytical plans without changing the SDK. Benchmark the actual
extension's scan/predicate behavior rather than assuming every declared SQLite index accelerates every DuckDB
query.
