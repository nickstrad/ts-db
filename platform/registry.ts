/**
 * The deployment registry (plan item 22, work 1): which apps this process serves, where their files
 * live, and the per-app services built over them.
 *
 * - `AppRegistryLive` is the `AppRegistry` service over `Config`. The registry is a deployment
 *   decision, never a path supplied by an HTTP caller; `Config.apps` lists the apps and their
 *   tokens, and each app's SQLite file sits under `Config.server.dataDir`.
 * - `AppServices` is the per-app half: one `Storage` (and the `Backups` bound to it) per app, because
 *   the writer owns one `DatabaseSync` handle per file (`platform/services.ts`, `Storage`). The live
 *   layer is built in `platform/layers.ts`; the HTTP router only sees this tag, so a test supplies
 *   in-memory stacks and a later tenancy layer (multitenancy plan MT-03/MT-07) can resolve stacks by
 *   tenant behind the same `get`.
 *
 * The pre-port `trace()` helper is gone: SQL tracing is the `sql` event kind at the `TRACE_SQL`
 * level (`Config.logging.traceSql`), written by the event log rather than to stderr.
