/**
 * The named analysis query catalog and `AnalysisLive` (plan item 23, §4.3).
 *
 * Callers choose a query by **name** and supply **scalar parameters**; they never supply SQL. Every
 * catalog entry is a `SELECT`/`WITH` over the v2 event-log tables in `core/eventlog/ddl.ts`, with every
 * caller-influenced value bound as a named parameter (`$since`, `$traceId`, …) and never interpolated.
 * `AnalysisLive` additionally opens the event-log file `READ_ONLY`, so even a catalog bug could not
 * write to it.
 *
 * The catalog is a plain record and is meant to be extended: a new entry is one more key, and nothing
 * here enumerates the names except `ANALYSIS_QUERY_NAMES`, which is derived from the record.
 * `docs/observability.md` documents each entry; `tests/unit/analysis_catalog_test.ts` asserts the doc
 * and this record list the same names.
 *
 * ## Parameters
 *
 * Each entry declares its parameters (`ParamSpec`): a type (`string`, `number`, `timestamp`), whether it
 * is required, and an optional default. `resolveParams` rejects an unknown or missing parameter and
 * coerces CLI strings (`--param limit=20`) to the declared type. Every declared parameter is bound on
 * every run — an absent optional one as `NULL` — so each SQL string references a fixed parameter set.
 * Time windows are `since` (inclusive) / `until` (exclusive), both optional.
 *
 * ## Schema notes the SQL depends on
 *
 * - `queue_events`, `backup_events` and `lifecycle_events` carry no `trace_id`; `queue_events` has no
 *   `app_id`. `trace` therefore unions only the tables that have the column.
 * - `http_events` has no `outcome`: a request is an error when `status >= 400` or `error_tag` is set.
 * - `platform_events.event_kind = 'handler'` rows carry the routed handler's `handler_kind`
 *   (`query` = reader path, `mutation` = writer path) and `outcome`.
 * - `k6_points` is filled by `perf:ingest` (item 25); when empty, `k6-vs-platform` returns zero rows.
