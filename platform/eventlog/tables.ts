/**
 * The typed event tables (plan items 21 and 35, §4.1): how one ingested JSONL record becomes a row in
 * each DuckDB table, plus the one-off v1 → v2 schema upgrade. The ingest statements are statements
 * only — `platform/eventlog/ingest.ts` decides when to run them, inside the one transaction per batch
 * that also moves `_ingest_state`.
 *
 * Every statement here against an event table is an `INSERT ... SELECT` from the batch's staging
 * relations (or, in `upgradeEventLog`, from a rebuilt copy). Nothing in this module rewrites or
 * removes a row.
 *
 * ## Staging
 *
 * `ingest.ts` writes each source file's new complete lines to an offset-trimmed temp file, one
 * wrapper object per line: `{"source_file", "source_offset", "dedupe", "line"}`, where `line` is the
 * original line *as a JSON string*. `read_json_auto` over that explicit file list therefore never
 * parses a record itself, so one malformed record cannot fail the read, and DuckDB's JSON functions
 * are the single judge of what is well-formed:
 *
 * - `ingest_stage`: every staged line plus a `reject_reason` (`NULL` when the line is ingestible).
 * - `ingest_rows`: the ingestible lines as `JSON`, minus — for a file that is or was rewritten only —
 *   lines whose `eventId` is already in `platform_events` (see `core/eventlog/offsets.ts`).
 *
 * A line is ingestible iff it is valid JSON, an object, has a non-empty string `eventId`, and has a
 * `ts` DuckDB can read as a timestamp. A wrong-typed *field* is not a reject: that column is `NULL`.
 *
 * ## Column mapping (schema v2, ADR 0006)
 *
 * Every ingestible record lands in `platform_events`; records of a typed kind also land in that
 * kind's table (`TYPED_EVENT_TABLES`). `handler` and `ingest` records have no typed table. As
 * `core/events.ts` documents:
 *
 * - **Identity.** `event_id` is the record's `eventId`, in `platform_events` and in its typed table.
 *   Both inserts read the same `ingest_rows`, in one transaction, so every typed row has exactly one
 *   `platform_events` row with its `event_id`, and that row's `event_kind` is the typed table's kind.
 *   Duplicates follow the offset model's rules (see "Identity under duplicates" below).
 * - **Taxonomy.** `platform_events.event_kind` is the record's `kind`, always. `handler_kind` is
 *   `handlerKind` mapped explicitly — `query` → `query`, `mutation` → `mutation`, anything else
 *   `NULL` — for `http` and `handler` records, and `NULL` for every other kind. `http_events.handler_kind`
 *   is the same mapping. Legacy JSONL shaped after §4.1's original field list, a handler record whose
 *   `kind` is itself `query` or `mutation`, maps to `event_kind = 'handler'` with that `handler_kind`.
 * - `platform_events.attrs` is `errorDetail` (for `lifecycle` records, `detail`).
 * - `platform_events.name` is the record's most specific label: `name` (http, handler),
 *   `statementKind` (sql), `queue` (queue), `phase` (backup, lifecycle), `sourceFile` (ingest).
 * - `platform_events.outcome` keeps each kind's own vocabulary, so item 23 can tell failures apart:
 *   `outcome` (`ok`/`error`; for `tx`, `commit`/`rollback`/`interrupted`), `event` (queue), `status`
 *   (ingest), and for `http` — which has no outcome field — `error` when `errorTag` is set or `status`
 *   is 5xx, else `ok` (a 5xx answered without a tagged error is still a server failure).
 * - **Backups.** `backup_events.emitter` is `emitter` (`backups` or `object-store`), `run_id` is
 *   `runId`, `attempts` is `attempts`. A record written before item 35 has no `emitter`; it is inferred
 *   from what each producer wrote then: `put-object` came from the object store, except the record
 *   `Backups` wrote for an interrupted upload (`errorTag` `Interrupted`, `errorDetail.written`
 *   `unknown`); every other phase came from `Backups`. Such records have no `run_id`.
 * - `ts` is read as `TIMESTAMPTZ` and stored as its UTC wall time, so a `+02:00` offset is honoured
 *   rather than dropped (a plain `CAST(... AS TIMESTAMP)` silently ignores the offset).
 *
 * ## Identity under duplicates
 *
 * The same `eventId` can reach ingest twice only through a rewritten source (offsets.ts): a re-read
 * generation, or two copies inside one batch. Lines of a rewritten file land only if their `eventId`
 * is not already in `platform_events` and is the batch's first copy, so the canonical row and its typed
 * row exist once. Re-running ingest over an unchanged tree reads nothing. Duplicate *production* — an
 * outside process copying lines into a file whose ingested prefix it keeps intact — is outside the
 * offset model (ADR 0004): it would land twice, in both tables, and `SELECT event_id FROM
 * platform_events GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1` finds it. The platform's own writers never do it.
 *
 * ## Large integers
 *
 * The item-13 review found SQLite's `json_extract` mishandles integral doubles ≥ 2^53. DuckDB
 * 1.5.6's JSON reader (yyjson), probed with `work-scripts/deno/duckdb-json-bigint-probe.ts`:
 *
 * - An integer literal (`9007199254740993`) is typed `BIGINT`/`UBIGINT` and extracts exactly.
 * - A literal with a fraction or exponent (`9007199254740993.0`, `1e16`) is typed `DOUBLE` and has
 *   already been rounded to the nearest double (`...992`) by the time SQL sees it.
 * - `TRY_CAST('12.5' AS BIGINT)` *rounds* to 13, and out-of-range values become `NULL`.
 *
 * So `intOf` never casts a `DOUBLE` it cannot prove exact: an integral `DOUBLE` with magnitude
 * ≤ 2^53 - 1 is accepted, any other `DOUBLE` becomes `NULL`, a string is accepted only if it is all
 * digits (that is how `core/events.ts` serialises a `bigint`), and anything outside the column's
 * range is `NULL`. A `NULL` is an honest "unknown"; a silently rounded count is not. Note the JSONL
 * producers are JavaScript, so a `number` past 2^53 has lost precision *before* it is written —
 * DuckDB stores exactly what the line says, which is the most this side can promise.

/**
 * Upgrades the event-log file at `Config.eventLog.duckdbPath` from v1 to this build's schema, or does
 * nothing when it is absent or already current. The steps, each of which must succeed before the next:
 *
 * 1. **Refuse an unsafe start.** A `<file>.wal` beside the file means its last writer did not close it;
 *    the upgrade refuses rather than copy a half-checkpointed file. (Opening the file once — even the
 *    refused v2 ingest connection does — checkpoints it.) The schema is read through a `READ_ONLY`
 *    attach, which also fails if another process holds the file.
 * 2. **Preserve the original.** The v1 file is copied byte-for-byte to `<file>.v1-pending.duckdb` and
 *    fsynced. The copy takes its kept name, `<file>.v1-<instant>.duckdb`, only after the switch, so an
 *    attempt killed before then (OOM, power loss) leaves no timestamped orphan: its pending copy is a
 *    copy of a v1 file still in place, and the next attempt discards it with the other scratch files.
 * 3. **Rebuild through the real ingest.** `makeEventLogIngest` — the same entry, DDL and mappings every
 *    run uses — ingests the whole retained JSONL tree into `<file>.v2-rebuild.duckdb`, from offset 0.
 *    Like any first ingest it quarantines rejected lines and emits its anomalies, so a rebuild appends
 *    a second copy of each historical reject to `rejected.jsonl` (a duplicate in a diagnostic file).
 * 4. **Prove it is complete** against the copy (`verifyAndCarry`): no v1 event may be missing. If one
 *    is, fail `IngestError({ phase: "plan" })`: the side file and the copy are removed and the v1 file,
 *    with its `_ingest_state` offsets, is exactly as it was. A source that retention gzipped or deleted
 *    is the usual cause; this never discards the v1 rows that only it still holds.
 * 5. **Switch** by fsyncing the rebuilt file and renaming it over the original — atomic, so the path
 *    always names a whole v1 or a whole v2 file — then rename the copy to its kept name and fsync the
 *    directory so both renames survive a crash. A process killed between the two renames leaves a v2
 *    file and `<file>.v1-pending.duckdb` holding the only v1 original; nothing removes a pending copy
 *    while the live file is v2, and the operator renames it.
 *
 * Run it while nothing else has the event log open (the reader's ingest is refused on a v1 file anyway).
 * Item 36 owns calling it from ingest startup; until then it is an explicit operator step. The `READ_ONLY`
 * attach in step 1 refuses a file another *process* holds, but DuckDB's file lock is a per-process POSIX
 * lock, so it may not refuse a call from inside the reader while the reader's own ingest connection has
 * the file open. Item 36 must close that connection first, or serialize the call with ingest.
