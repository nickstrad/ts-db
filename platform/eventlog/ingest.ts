/**
 * `EventLogIngestLive`: idempotent, exactly-once ingest of the rotating JSONL event log into the
 * append-only DuckDB event tables (plan item 21).
 *
 * **Reader process only.** This module imports `@duckdb/node-api`; the writer (server) process must
 * never load it — see ADR 0004. The event-log DuckDB file (`Config.eventLog.duckdbPath`) is a
 * persistent file of its own, separate from the per-app `:memory:` instances `platform/duckdb.ts`
 * opens, and nothing here loads DuckDB's `sqlite` extension.
 *
 * ## One run
 *
 * 1. **Inventory**: list `LOG_DIR/<role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/events-*.jsonl` and read every
 *    `_ingest_state` row.
 * 2. **Plan**, per file: read its bytes and hand them to `core/eventlog/offsets.ts`'s `planFile`,
 *    which re-hashes the recorded prefix, decides `skip` / `new` / `append` / `rewritten`, and cuts
 *    the complete lines past the offset. Lines that are not UTF-8 or exceed `MAX_LINE_BYTES` are
 *    rejected here; the rest are written to an offset-trimmed temp file (see `tables.ts`).
 * 3. **Commit**, per batch of roughly `batchBytes` of new data: in **one DuckDB transaction**, stage the temp
 *    files with `read_json_auto` over the explicit file list, insert into the event tables, write
 *    rejected lines to quarantine, and upsert each file's `_ingest_state` row. Either all of it
 *    commits or none of it does, so a crash or a failed statement never advances an offset past rows
 *    that did not land, and never lands rows without advancing the offset.
 *
 * Event tables only ever receive `INSERT`s (from `tables.ts`); `_ingest_state` is the one mutable
 * table, and the upsert below is the only statement in this module that changes an existing row.
 *
 * ## Rejected lines
 *
 * A line that cannot be ingested is appended to `LOG_DIR/<role>/<date>/rejected.jsonl` beside its
 * source file, and the rest of the batch proceeds. (A line rejected for exceeding `MAX_LINE_BYTES`
 * keeps only its first 64 KiB of bytes there, decoded lossily, so a UTF-8 sequence cut at the end
 * becomes U+FFFD; the source JSONL still holds it in full.) Quarantine
 * is written *before* `COMMIT`: if the commit then fails, the next run quarantines the same lines
 * again. A duplicate in a diagnostic file
 * is the safe failure; a rejected line that vanished would not be. Each file with rejects yields one
 * `ingest` event.
 *
 * Only anomalies (rejected lines, a rewritten source, an unreadable file, a failed run) are emitted
 * as `ingest` events. A success event per run would itself be ingested by the next run, so a quiet
 * tree would never become an unchanged one.
 *
 * Quarantine records are fsynced (file, then directory) before the `COMMIT` that moves the offsets
 * past them, so a committed offset only ever covers a rejected line whose evidence is durable. That
 * is what lets retention count a rejected line as consumed (ADR 0007).
 *
 * ## Ingest, then sweep (item 36, ADR 0007)
 *
 * Retention may gzip or delete a source only once committed ingest covers all of it, and only this
 * process can see `_ingest_state`. So the coordinator lives here: `ingestThenSweep` runs, under the
 * same lock as `ingest`,
 *
 * 1. an ordinary ingest run — if it fails, the call fails and nothing is swept;
 * 2. `sealTornTails`: a closed source whose offset stops before a newline-free tail (a write that
 *    was torn by a crash or a failed write, which no sink will ever finish) has that tail quarantined
 *    as a `torn-tail` reject and its offset moved to the end, in one transaction;
 * 3. `platform/logging/retention.sweep`, with the committed rows and the accepted `source_offset`s
 *    as its ledger, so the gate judges exactly what is durable;
 * 4. a measurement of both budgets (`RetentionBudgets`).
 *
 * `eventLogIngestThenSweepLayer` provides the existing `EventLogIngest` tag with `ingest` bound to
 * that call, which is the whole hook items 32 and 33 need: the reader's existing `ingest` RPC gains
 * retention without a new request kind or a service change. A sweep failure is reported in the reply
 * (and as its own lifecycle event); it does not fail the ingest that already committed.
 *
 * The schema compatibility check (item 35) needs no extra wiring: every connection runs
 * `EVENTLOG_DDL`, whose guards refuse a v1 or foreign file before any statement touches it, so the
 * layer fails to build and no sweep can run against it. This module never calls `upgradeEventLog`;
 * it would have to close its own connection first (see that function), so it stays an operator step.
 *
 * `deno task check` reaches this module through `platform/layers.ts`'s type-only import; item 33
 * wires it into the reader entry point at runtime.
