/**
 * The composition roots (plan items 22 and 32): every live layer, wired once.
 *
 * ## `PlatformLive` — the server (writer) process
 *
 * The plan's sketch is `Layer.mergeAll(ConfigLive, LoggerLive, EventSinkLive, AppRegistryLive,
 * IdGenLive, StorageLive, ReaderClientLive, ObjectStoreLive, BackupsLive)`. Two things change in the
 * real wiring, both on purpose:
 *
 * 1. **`Storage` and `Backups` are per app.** The writer owns one SQLite connection per file, so
 *    there is one `StorageLive` (and one `BackupsLive` bound to it) per registered app.
 *    `AppServicesLive` builds those stacks into its own scope and exposes them behind the
 *    `AppServices` tag (`platform/registry.ts`); the router never sees a bare `Storage`.
 * 2. **The layers are a chain, not a flat merge.** `Layer.mergeAll` may build (and therefore
 *    release) its members concurrently, and shutdown order is load-bearing here. Each
 *    `Layer.provideMerge` below builds its argument first and releases it last, so acquisition and
 *    release are both total orders:
 *
 * ```text
 * acquire:  Config → Logging (sink + Logger) → shutdown marker → IdGen → ObjectStore, AppRegistry
 *           → AppServices (Storage + Backups, per app, in registry order) → ReaderClient (child)
 * release:  ReaderClient → AppServices (apps in reverse) → … → shutdown marker → Logging → Config
 * ```
 *
 * `platform/server.ts` acquires the ingest/sweep and backup fibers and then the HTTP listener inside
 * this context, so the full shutdown sequence is HTTP drain → backup and ingest/sweep fibers → reader
 * child → DB handles → final `lifecycle` event → log flush. The "shutdown marker" is a finalizer-only
 * layer that emits the `lifecycle` `shutdown` event after everything that could still log has closed
 * and before the sink drains, so it is the last line of the server's log file.
 *
 * ## Partial startup (item 32)
 *
 * Every resource is acquired by a scoped layer, from the first SQLite handle onward, so a failure at
 * any later step — a second app's file that will not open, a reader that will not answer, a port that
 * is taken — closes everything acquired before it, in reverse, and still flushes the log. Nothing is
 * opened outside a scope, so there is no window in which a handle exists that no finalizer owns.
 *
 * The resource steps leave evidence in the log: `sqlite-library` once, before the first open (the
 * `libsqlite3` every connection in this process uses: requested and resolved path, version),
 * `storage-opened`/`storage-closed` per app (emitted
 * here; `storage-closed` only after that app's handle and writer queue have closed, and only if it
 * opened), `reader-spawned`/`reader-exited` (`platform/ipc.ts`). `makePlatformLive`'s `afterStep`
 * hook runs after each step acquires; tests use it to inject a failure or an interruption at exactly
 * that point (`tests/unit/server_scope_test.ts`). It is a no-op in production.
 *
 * Memoization: within one build, Effect memoizes layers by reference, so `ConfigLive` and the
 * logging layer — required by nearly every other layer — are each built exactly once and shared.
 * The per-app stacks are built with their own `Layer.build`, but every service they need besides
 * `Storage` (`Config`, `EventSink`, `IdGen`, `ObjectStore`) comes from this chain's context, not
 * from a layer, so nothing below them is built twice: one sink, one object store, one child.
 * `Layer.memoize` (which shares a layer across *separate* builds) has no second build to serve in
 * this process, so it is not used.
 *
 * ## The reader process root
 *
 * The two processes must not share a module graph: this one loads the system `libsqlite3` through
 * the FFI binding (`platform/sqlite_ffi/`, for `StorageLive`, the document reader and backups), the
 * reader loads `@duckdb/node-api` with its own SQLite inside, and one process must never open a file
 * through two SQLite copies (ADR 0001, `platform/duckdb.ts`). So the reader's root cannot live here
 * as a value — importing `EventLogIngestLive` would load DuckDB into the writer, and
 * `platform/reader.ts` importing this module would load the binding into the reader. What is fixed
 * here is its *shape*:
 * `ReaderProcessServices` = `Config` + the reader's `EventSink` (`LoggingReaderLive`) +
 * `EventLogIngest`, with per-app `ReaderLive` instances opened lazily by `makeReaderPool`
 * (`platform/duckdb.ts`) inside the reader's program scope. `platform/reader.ts` composes it
 * (item 33). The server reaches the event log only through the reader's `ingest` RPC, which item 36's
 * ingest-then-sweep coordinator answers there (ADR 0007); this process never opens the event-log
 * DuckDB file.
 *
 * The event-log modules are imported below **as types only**: `deno task check` type-checks
 * `platform/eventlog/*` through this file, and nothing of theirs is loaded at runtime.
 *
 * ## Seams for the multitenancy plan
 *
 * MT-05/MT-07 replace `AppRegistryLive`/`AppServicesLive` (resolve stacks per tenant behind the same
 * `AppServices.get`) and the auth functions in `platform/http/auth.ts`; nothing else in this chain
 * names an app.
