/**
 * The logging service (plan item 11): `EventSinkLive`, the Effect `Logger` that funnels
 * `Effect.log*` into the same records, and the layer that wires both over `Config`.
 *
 * ## The shape of it
 *
 * ```text
 *   emit(record) ─┐                        (never blocks, never fails)
 *                 ├─> Queue.dropping(capacity) ─> consumer fiber ─> FileSink ─> events-HH-pid-NNN.jsonl
 *   Effect.log* ──┘        drops counted              forkScoped        rolls on date/hour/size
 *                          and reported as a
 *                          `queue` event
 * ```
 *
 * Four decisions carry the item, each of them a way of not losing records:
 *
 * 1. **`Queue.dropping`, never `Queue.bounded`.** A mutation must never wait on, or fail because
 *    of, logging (plan item 11 step 3). Producers `unsafeOffer` and move on; an offer that does not
 *    fit increments a counter instead of applying backpressure.
 * 2. **Drops are themselves events.** Each flush that follows one or more rejected offers writes a
 *    `queue` record (`event: "dropped"`, with `depth`/`cap`/`dropped` — the §4.1 `queue_events`
 *    columns) *in its own append, before the batch*, so the report cannot be dropped by the very
 *    saturation it describes, and cannot be lost along with a failing data batch. Drop reports
 *    ignore the `logLevel` gate: silence here would defeat the purpose.
 * 3. **The consumer drains, it does not accumulate.** Every iteration takes *everything* queued
 *    (`Queue.takeAll`, which is atomic and cannot lose a value to interruption the way a timed-out
 *    `take` can), writes it in `BATCH_MAX` slices, and sleeps only when it drained less than a full
 *    slice. So there is no long-lived accumulator to grow unboundedly (sq-01 pitfall 2) and a
 *    backlog is never parked behind the flush timer, while a trickle still costs one write per
 *    `eventFlushMs`.
 * 4. **Finalizer order is load-bearing.** Finalizers run LIFO, so they are added in reverse:
 *    `close` first, `drain` second, `forkScoped`'s interrupt last. Shutdown therefore runs
 *    interrupt → drain → close: the consumer stops, what it left behind (plus anything still in the
 *    queue) is written, and only then is the handle closed. Reverse that order and the drain writes
 *    into a closed handle (sq-01 pitfall 1).
 *
 * Writes are `Effect.uninterruptible`, so an interrupt arriving mid-flush cannot leave a half-written
 * batch for the drain to duplicate. Signal handling is *not* wired here: graceful shutdown is
 * whatever closes this layer's scope, and the server/reader entrypoints (items 16 and 22) own the
 * SIGTERM/SIGINT wiring that gets there (sq-01 pitfall 4).
 *
 * `console.error` appears exactly once in this directory, in `noteFailure`: the documented
 * degradation path for when the event log itself cannot be written, rate-limited to one line per
 * minute of wall time (plan item 11 step 3). There is no `console.log` anywhere.
