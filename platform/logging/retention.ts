/**
 * The retention sweeper (plan items 24 and 36): the half of retention that touches the disk.
 *
 * `core/logging/rotation.plan` (items 06, 12) decides, purely and property-tested, which files to
 * gzip, delete and keep. Item 36 put a gate in front of it (`rotation.retentionBlock`, ADR 0007): no
 * event-log file is gzipped or deleted unless it is closed, settled, still the file that was read,
 * and fully accounted for by **committed** ingest. This module gathers the facts that gate judges,
 * pins every file that fails it, and executes what is left. Deleting files is the risky half, so the
 * shape is: *inventory → gate → plan → safety rails → validate → apply*, with every step before
 * "apply" side-effect free, and `dryRun` stopping right after validation.
 *
 * ```text
 *   inventory(root) ─> gate each candidate ─> rotation.plan(pinned) ─> rails ─> validatePlan ─> apply
 *     (read only)       (read + hash, ledger)   (pure; loops until no      (open,    (containment,   (delete,
 *                                                new candidate appears)     .tmp)     verified)        gzip, rmdir)
 * ```
 *
 * ## The gate (item 36)
 *
 * A sweep needs an `IngestLedger`: the committed `_ingest_state` rows (read *after* the ingest that
 * precedes the sweep committed) and the accepted `source_offset`s of the derived store. This module
 * never opens DuckDB — it runs in the server and the CLI too — so the ledger is supplied by the
 * caller; `platform/eventlog/ingest.ts`'s ingest-then-sweep coordinator is the one live supplier.
 * Without a ledger there is no sweep.
 *
 * Each event file `plan` wants to gzip or delete is read in full (decompressed, for a `.gz`) and
 * judged by `retentionBlock`: closed (not open here; dated before today, which no sink can write to
 * again; mtime older than `settleMs`), unchanged since the inventory (size, mtime, inode, before and
 * after the read), watermark covering the whole content with a matching hash, and — for a source
 * never rewritten — every record offset accounted for exactly once by an accepted row or a durable
 * quarantine record in its directory's `rejected.jsonl`. A file that fails is **pinned**: kept,
 * still counted toward `maxTotalBytes`, and reported as `blocked` (the unsafe-to-delete backlog).
 * Pinning can make the cap reach a newer directory, whose files are then judged too; the loop ends
 * when a plan names no file that has not been judged. A `rejected.jsonl` is pinned
 * (`quarantine-evidence`) while any event file in its directory is not being deleted.
 *
 * ## Safety rails
 *
 * - **Containment.** Every planned path is `resolve`d and must sit strictly under the resolved
 *   `LOG_DIR`, and must have exactly the shape `<root>/<role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<file>` with a known
 *   role and an event-log file name. So `LOG_DIR/duckdb/events.duckdb`, `LOG_DIR/k6/…` and anything
 *   outside the root are refused even if a plan names them. A dated directory that is a symlink
 *   out of the tree is refused by a `realPath` check on each file's parent. One bad path refuses
 *   the *whole* plan before anything is touched, and emits an `error` lifecycle event.
 * - **Verified only.** `applyPlan` refuses (`unverified`) any event file in `gzip` or `delete`
 *   that the gate did not pass, so a plan built by hand cannot bypass it.
 * - **Today's directory** (and anything dated later) is never in a plan; `validatePlan` re-checks
 *   that independently of `rotation.plan` as defence in depth. A future-dated directory (clock skew,
 *   a restored backup) is held out of `rotation.plan` entirely and reported as `futureDated`, so it
 *   can neither be touched nor make `validatePlan` refuse the rest of the sweep.
 * - **Resolved paths only.** `applyPlan` normalises every planned path with `resolve` and hands
 *   *only* that to the filesystem and to the lifecycle event. `resolve` is lexical, so a raw
 *   `LOG_DIR/server/link/../<date>/<file>` that was validated as `LOG_DIR/server/<date>/<file>`
 *   would otherwise be executed by the OS as "follow `link`, then go up" — somewhere else entirely.
 * - **The open file.** The caller passes the paths its sink holds open (`FileSink.openPath`); they
 *   are pinned whatever the plan said. A sweep run from another process relies on the closed rule:
 *   a sink only ever appends while the clock is inside its file's hour bucket and never reopens a
 *   file it rolled away from, so a file dated before today and settled can receive no more bytes.
 * - **Recheck before every destructive step.** Immediately before removing a file (a plain delete, or
 *   the source after its gzip is verified) its parent directory is `realPath`ed again and must still
 *   be inside the real `LOG_DIR`, and the file must still be the regular file, size, mtime and inode
 *   the inventory saw; a gzip also re-hashes the source against the gate's hash. An append, a swap or
 *   a symlink trick between the gate and the delete is a skip, not a loss. (A check-then-unlink race
 *   can only be narrowed, not removed, without `openat`; the closed rule is what makes it moot.)
 * - **Gzip is atomic and verified.** `<file>.gz.<pid>.tmp` is written and fsynced, renamed to
 *   `<file>.gz`, decompressed and hashed against the source, the directory is fsynced, and only then
 *   is the source removed. Byte offsets survive compression: the `.gz` decompresses to exactly the
 *   bytes ingest committed, and the source's `_ingest_state` row is kept (ADR 0007).
 * - **Durability.** Every touched directory is fsynced once more when the sweep is done. A
 *   filesystem that cannot fsync a directory is skipped, not an error.
 * - Anything else in a dated directory (an operator's notes, a subdirectory, a symlink) is never
 *   inventoried or touched, and keeps its directory from being removed.
 *
 * ## Crash and retry (ADR 0007)
 *
 * Every step is idempotent, so a crash anywhere is repaired by the next sweep: a `.tmp` from a gzip
 * that died is deleted once it is an hour old; a complete `.gz` beside its source (crash after the
 * rename) is verified against the gate's hash and the source removed, while a `.gz` that does not
 * match is left with its source for a human; a delete either happened or is retried. Quarantine files
 * are deleted last, and only once their directory holds no event file at all.
 *
 * Only `events-<HH>-<pid>-<seq>.jsonl[.gz]` and the ingest quarantine file `rejected.jsonl` are
 * inventoried. `rejected.jsonl` is never gzipped: ingest appends to it.
 *
 * ## Scheduling
 *
 * `startRetentionSweeper` is a `forkScoped` fiber: one sweep immediately, then one per `every`. It
 * never fails. It needs a ledger like any sweep, so in practice the scheduled path is the reader's
 * ingest RPC (item 32 triggers it, item 33 hosts it), which runs ingest and then this sweep.
 *
 * A dry run that succeeds emits no event: the event sink writes a file, and a dry run must change
 * nothing on disk. A dry run that *fails* still emits its `error` lifecycle event.
 *
 * ## Events
 *
 * A real sweep emits one `lifecycle` event, phase `retention-sweep`, when it did, skipped or was
 * blocked from anything (`warn` if anything was skipped, blocked or future-dated); a sweep with
 * nothing to do emits nothing, so a quiet tree stays quiet once its events are ingested. An
 * interrupted sweep emits `retention-sweep-interrupted`; a refused or failed one
 * `retention-sweep-failed`. Each carries `gzippedCount`, `deletedCount` and `keptCount` next to its
 * path lists, and `blockedCount`/`blockedBytes` next to the first `MAX_LISTED_BLOCKED` blocked files.
