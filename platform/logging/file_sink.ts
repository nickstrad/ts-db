/**
 * The rotating JSONL file sink (plan item 11, §4.2): the only module in this repo that writes
 * event-log bytes to disk.
 *
 * It owns exactly one `Deno.FsFile`, opened in append mode, and the `RollState` that goes with it.
 * Every write first asks `core/logging/rotation.shouldRoll` whether that handle is still the right
 * one for `now`; a `"date"`/`"hour"` answer closes it and opens a file in the new dated directory,
 * a `"size"` answer bumps `seq` within the same hour bucket. Nothing here decides *when* to write
 * (that is `logger.ts`'s batching fiber) and nothing here decides what a record looks like (that is
 * `core/events.ts`'s `toJsonLine`): this module is open/append/roll/close and nothing else.
 *
 * Three rules keep the mechanics honest:
 *
 * 1. **All state transitions happen under one `Effect.Semaphore` permit.** The batching fiber and
 *    the scope's drain finalizer are two different fibers writing the same handle (the finalizer
 *    runs on the fiber that closes the scope, not on the interrupted consumer), so `append` and
 *    `close` must not interleave.
 * 2. **Failures surface in the error channel as `SinkIoError`.** They are *not* swallowed here.
 *    `logger.ts` is the layer that must never fail, and it catches these to degrade (drop + count +
 *    one stderr line a minute). Keeping the sink honest about I/O is what lets the degradation
 *    policy live in exactly one place.
 * 3. **A file, once left, is never written again** — the contract retention's closed-file rule rests
 *    on (item 36, ADR 0007). Every append first rolls if `now` has left the open file's hour bucket,
 *    a roll always opens a fresh `seq` (one past the highest on disk, `.gz` included), and a failed
 *    write abandons the handle rather than finishing its torn line. So a file dated before today,
 *    once its last in-flight write has settled, can gain no more bytes from any sink, and the
 *    ingest-then-sweep coordinator may seal its torn tail and, once ingested, gzip or delete it.
 *    Changing any of this (reopening a file to finish a line, appending under a stale bucket) would
 *    let retention remove bytes that were never ingested. Buckets are local time, so every process
 *    sharing a `LOG_DIR` must share one timezone (ADR 0007).
 *
 * `rotation.currentPath` is the single source of truth for the on-disk layout, but it hard-codes
 * the `logs/` root segment (`logs/<role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/events-<HH>-<pid>-<seq>.jsonl`). `LOG_DIR`
 * replaces exactly that one segment, so the date bucket, hour bucket, pid and zero-padded `seq` are
 * still formatted in one place and the two modules cannot drift.
