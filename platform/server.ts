/**
 * The server (writer) process entrypoint (plan items 22 and 32): `PlatformLive`, one HTTP listener
 * over `platform/http/router.ts`, the ingest-then-sweep and backup timers, and shutdown.
 *
 * Everything runs in one root fiber over one `Scope`. Resources are acquired in the order below, so
 * closing the scope releases them in exactly the reverse order:
 *
 * ```text
 * main          stop signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM listeners)
 * PlatformLive  Config → logging → shutdown marker → IdGen → ObjectStore, AppRegistry
 *               → per-app Storage + Backups → ReaderClient (child process)      (platform/layers.ts)
 * program       reader ping → ingest-then-sweep fiber → backup fiber → HTTP listener
 *
 * shutdown:     HTTP drain → backup fiber → ingest-then-sweep fiber → reader child → DB handles
 *               → `lifecycle` shutdown event → log drain + close → signal listeners
 * ```
 *
 * - **HTTP drain first.** `server.shutdown()` stops accepting and waits for in-flight requests, so a
 *   mutation that was admitted completes (or rolls back on its own failure) against a still-open
 *   database before anything below it closes. The storage finalizer additionally waits for its
 *   writer queue to drain. The reader child runs in its own process group (`platform/ipc.ts`), so a
 *   group signal (Ctrl-C, a systemd stop) reaches only this process and cannot stop the reader
 *   ahead of the drain.
 * - **Signals interrupt the root fiber.** SIGINT/SIGTERM complete a `Deferred`. Once serving, the
 *   program emits a `lifecycle` `stopping` event naming the signal and then interrupts itself, which
 *   closes the scope. The listeners are installed before `PlatformLive` builds, and a signal while it
 *   builds or while the startup ping waits interrupts startup at once (releasing whatever was
 *   acquired, log included). They are removed last, so a second signal during shutdown cannot kill
 *   the process half-way.
 * - **Partial startup releases everything.** Every step from the first SQLite handle onward is
 *   scoped, so a failure at any later step — a second app's file, the reader's ping, the HTTP bind
 *   (`ListenError`, e.g. a port in use) — closes what was acquired before it, in reverse, and the
 *   process exits 1 with no child and no handle left behind.
 * - **The reader child is supervised, not load-bearing.** If it exits unexpectedly while the
 *   server is serving, a supervisor respawns it with backoff (`reader-restarting` /
 *   `reader-restarted` lifecycle events); queries answer 502 only during the restart window and
 *   resume on the new child. Only if the supervisor gives up (more than 5 restarts within 10
 *   minutes) does the server log `stopping` (reason `reader-exited`), shut down in the order
 *   above, and exit 1, so a supervisor restarts both processes together.
 * - **The log flushes last.** The `lifecycle` `shutdown` event is emitted by a finalizer that sits
 *   directly above the logging layer, so it is the final line of the server's log file.
 *
 * ## Event-log ingest and retention
 *
 * This process never opens the event-log DuckDB file (ADR 0004). Every `INGEST_SWEEP_INTERVAL` it
 * sends the reader the existing `ingest` RPC. Until item 33 lands the reader answers it with an
 * `IngestError` ("not available"); item 33 connects the RPC to `EventLogIngestLive`'s
 * ingest-then-sweep coordinator (ADR 0007): ingest, then — only after a committed ingest — the
 * retention sweep. `POST /admin/logs/ingest` sends the same RPC on demand. The first run is one
 * interval after startup, so a restart never queues a long ingest ahead of the first queries.
 *
 * The ingest RPC shares the reader connection's per-call deadline (`READER_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS`, sized for
 * queries). A run that takes longer is logged here as `ingest-sweep-failed` (`IpcError` timeout)
 * while the reader carries on and commits; its late reply is then a `reader-reply-anomaly`. A
 * per-call deadline needs a `ReaderClient` change (`platform/ipc.ts`, not this module's).
 *
 * Only an abnormal end reaches stderr — a failure to *start* (bad configuration, schema drift, a
 * reader that will not answer, a port in use), the reader exiting while serving, or the listener
 * closing on its own — because the event log may not exist yet or may be the thing that broke; the
 * process then exits 1. A signal is a normal stop: exit 0.
