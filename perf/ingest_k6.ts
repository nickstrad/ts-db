/**
 * `deno task perf:ingest` (plan item 25): loads one k6 run's `--out json=` file into a `k6_points`
 * DuckDB table, so client-side latency can be joined against the server's event tables.
 *
 * ```text
 *   logs/k6/<run-id>/raw.json  ──read_json_auto──>  logs/k6/<run-id>/k6.duckdb : k6_points
 * ```
 *
 * - **Run id.** `K6_RUN_ID`, default `k6-smoke` — the same default as `deno task perf:smoke`, so
 *   `deno task perf:smoke && deno task perf:ingest` needs no arguments.
 * - **Output file.** `logs/k6/<run-id>/k6.duckdb` beside the raw file, or `K6_DUCKDB` when set. Never
 *   the server's event-log file: the reader child holds that one open (and locked) while it runs. A
 *   query that needs both attaches the event log, e.g. `ATTACH '<eventlog.duckdb>' AS events
 *   (READ_ONLY)` from a connection on this file.
 * - **Schema.** `k6_points` exactly as `core/eventlog/ddl.ts` declares it — the one place the schema
 *   lives: `ts TIMESTAMP` (UTC), `run_id`, `metric`, `value DOUBLE`, `scenario`, `status`,
 *   `trace_id`, `tags JSON`. Only `Point` lines are loaded; k6 interleaves them with `Metric` lines
 *   that describe each metric once (`work-scripts/deno/k6-raw-duckdb-check.ts`).
 * - **Idempotent per run.** One transaction deletes the run's existing rows and inserts the file's
 *   points, so a re-run replaces that run and leaves any other run in the same file untouched.
 *
 * k6 writes `data.time` as RFC 3339 with the host's offset and nanosecond digits; it is read as
 * `TIMESTAMPTZ` and stored as UTC, the same convention as the event tables (`ts` there is UTC too).
 * `trace_id` is the point's `trace_id` tag when a script sets one; `perf/lib/api.js` sends
 * `X-Trace-Id` as a request header only, so for today's scenarios it is `NULL` and a join correlates
 * by time bucket and by the run id embedded in the server-side trace ids instead.
 *
 * Loads `@duckdb/node-api` and nothing that loads `node:sqlite` (ADR 0001).
