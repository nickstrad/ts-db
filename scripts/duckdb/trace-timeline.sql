-- trace-timeline.sql
--
-- Question: the complete ordered event timeline for one trace_id across both processes —
-- mirrors the plan's named `trace` analysis query (§4.3, item 23).
-- Tables: platform_events, sql_events, tx_events, http_events, k6_points (schema v2).
-- The supported form of this query is `deno task logs:query trace --param traceId=<id>`
-- (platform/analysis/catalog.ts), which also drops the platform_events rows that
-- sql_events/tx_events/http_events already carry. This file follows the same deduplication.
-- Variables: $trace_id.
--
-- Assumption: only these five tables carry a trace_id column in §4.1's DDL —
-- queue_events, backup_events and lifecycle_events do not, so they can't be joined into
-- a trace timeline and are intentionally excluded here.
