/**
 * The Effect test runner (plan item 20): tests are effects, `node:test` still runs them.
 *
 * `runTest(name, effect)` registers a `node:test` case that provides `TestLayer` (every in-memory
 * double plus `TestClock`) and a `Scope`, runs the effect with `Effect.runPromiseExit`, and turns a
 * failed exit into a thrown error. A thrown `assert` failure inside the effect is a defect, and is
 * rethrown as-is so `node:test` prints its diff; any other failure is rethrown with the whole
 * `Cause` rendered, so a typed error that has no `message` is still readable.
 *
 * Per-test services go in `options.layer`, built on top of `TestLayer` (so they may require any of
 * its services), e.g. `{ layer: StorageTest({ schema }) }`. The layer's outputs are inferred from
 * `options.layer` only, so an effect that needs a service nobody provided is a type error, not a
 * runtime "service not found".
