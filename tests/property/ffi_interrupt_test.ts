/**
 * FFI-07, work 2: interrupt totality. A nonblocking statement (`allAsync`, and the Effect layer's
 * `allAsync`) given a random statement and a random interrupt delay of 0-50 ms ALWAYS terminates, with
 * exactly one of
 *
 * - its rows (the statement finished first, and the rows are the ones the same statement returns
 *   undisturbed), or
 * - the cancellation its mechanism promises: `SqliteCancelled` (`reason: "deadline"` for `timeoutMs`,
 *   `"aborted"` for an `AbortSignal`, either when both are armed) or, for fiber interruption through
 *   `Effect.timeout`, Effect's `TimeoutException`.
 *
 * It never hangs, and it never leaves the connection unusable: the very next statement, blocking and
 * nonblocking, answers, and `db.inFlight` is false.
 *
 * Hang safety, in three layers:
 *
 * 1. The WHOLE iteration (the statement, its outcome checks and the recovery probes) is raced against
 *    a hard wall-clock guard (`GUARD_MS`) that FAILS the property when hit. The guard is cleared only
 *    after the last probe. A hit marks the connection `stuck`, and every further run (fast-check's
 *    shrinking) returns at once: nothing is replayed against a connection whose execution timed out.
 * 2. Cleanup closes the database with `closeAsync` (which cancels an in-flight execution and waits for
 *    its pool thread). A close error is a test failure. If `closeAsync` has not finished within
 *    `CLOSE_GRACE_MS`, a native step is running that nothing in this process can stop, so the test
 *    reports it and kills the process (SIGKILL, exit 137): a stuck native execution must not survive
 *    into later tests, and abandoning it only moves the crash to runtime teardown (SIGSEGV, exit 139).
 * 3. A watchdog on its own thread (a `Worker`) kills the process with SIGKILL if the iteration makes
 *    no progress for `BACKSTOP_MS`. That is the only layer that covers a synchronous stall, which
 *    blocks the event loop and so every timer on it. Its report names the iteration's inputs.
 *
 * A failure report carries the iteration's inputs (statement, mechanism and delays), phase, elapsed
 * time and the host load average. The seed fixes the generated inputs, not scheduling: a timing
 * failure can recur only under similar load, so replay with `PROP_SEED` and compare the recorded load.
 *
 * Statements (one prepared set, reused across all iterations, so a cancelled statement is also reused):
 * `forever` (an unbounded recursive CTE: must be cancelled), `cte` and `join` (a few hundred ms of CPU
 * on this VM: either outcome is valid), `scan` (a few ms), and `point` and `trivial` (microseconds:
 * almost always rows, but a delay of 0 may legitimately cancel them first). The generators hit both
 * outcomes; the test asserts, with seed-independent floors, that it saw at least 20 of each overall and
 * at least one rows result and one cancellation under every mechanism (not every shape under every
 * mechanism: 200 runs do not sample all 24 combinations evenly).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT generated: statements that wait on a lock. `sqlite3_interrupt` does not cut a
 * `busy_timeout` wait (`docs/knowledge/gotchas.md`, FFI-05), so a blocked statement ends with
 * `SQLITE_BUSY` after the whole timeout rather than `SqliteCancelled`. There is one connection on one
 * temp file here, so `SQLITE_BUSY` cannot occur, and any `SqliteError` fails the property.
 *
 * `numRuns: 200` (the plan's 200 iterations), seed from `PROP_SEED` (default 20261010). Sweep:
 * `bash work-scripts/bash/property-seed-sweep.sh tests/property/ffi_interrupt_test.ts - 1 200`.
