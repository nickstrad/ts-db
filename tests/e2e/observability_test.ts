/**
 * End-to-end observability check (plan item 25): k6 client-side latency joined to the server's own
 * handler durations, both read back out of DuckDB.
 *
 * ```text
 * scratch server ──k6 smoke (30 s)──> logs/k6/<run>/raw.json ──perf/ingest_k6.ts──> k6.duckdb : k6_points
 *       │                                                                                 │
 *       └─ JSONL ──POST /admin/logs/ingest──> eventlog.duckdb : platform_events ──ATTACH──┘
 *                                                                     k6-vs-platform join
 * ```
 *
 * The join buckets both sides by `time_bucket(INTERVAL 10 seconds, ts)`: client p95 of k6's
 * `http_req_duration` for the run, and server p95 of `handler` `duration_ms` for the requests whose
 * trace id k6 minted for the run (`perf/lib/api.js`: `<vu>-<iter>-<run id>`). Both processes run on
 * this machine, so their wall clocks bucket alike. The assertions:
 *
 * - the join returns rows, and every bucket either side has is matched on the other;
 * - client p95 >= server p95 in every bucket. Not a tautology: the handler span runs strictly inside
 *   the request k6 times, so each request's client duration bounds its server duration, and a p95
 *   over the same requests inherits the bound. A mis-bucketed clock, a wrong duration column or a
 *   unit mix-up breaks it.
 *
 * Run: `deno run -A tests/e2e/observability_test.ts` (needs `k6` on `PATH`; ~45 s).
 *
 * The k6 latency gate is the adopted host-dependent rule (sq-08): p(95) < 160 ms on the shared
 * VM, < 60 ms on a quiet host, decided per host at run time — `K6_HOST_CLASS=quiet` selects the
 * quiet-host gate, unset (or anything else) means the shared VM. A p95 at or above the threshold
 * is a load refusal: the host was too noisy for the run to serve as a regression signal. It is
 * recorded in `perf/baseline.json` and fails the run loudly. p99 is never gated (too noisy).
 *
 * Negative control: `OBS_SINK=noop deno run -A tests/e2e/observability_test.ts` must fail. It starts
 * the server (and its reader) with `LOG_LEVEL=error`, so `EventSinkLive`'s level gate drops every
 * record below `error` before it is queued — on a clean run, every record either process emits (the
 * test prints the server-log record count to show it). No handler events reach the JSONL, ingest has
 * none to load, and the join returns no rows. It is a config setting rather than a substituted
 * `EventSink`: the server's composition has no sink seam, and a module-level switch in
 * `platform/logging/logger.ts` would break the rule that only `platform/config.ts` reads the
 * environment (`tests/unit/server_scope_test.ts`).
 *
 * Not covered here: `deno task logs:query k6-vs-platform` is item 23's CLI over its catalog; this
 * file verifies the data and the join underneath it.
