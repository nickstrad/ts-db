# haiku-24 — Opus review: Retention sweeper (plan item 24)

**Branch:** `haiku/24-sweeper` (`68d0188`) **Reviewer:** Opus, 2026-10-10 **Review worktree:**
`origin/haiku/24-sweeper` at `/root/Software/tsdb-work/rev24` (read-only) **Verdict: NITS, but only after
wrapper repair** — the best of the three items. Haiku's structure and bulk tests are sound; the one safety
rail the plan calls out as the reason this item exists was absent, and the test meant to prove it asserted
nothing.

## Attribution — read this first

**The pushed branch does not separate Haiku's work from the supervising agent's fixes.** The fixes were
`--amend`ed into Haiku's single commit, so `git log origin/haiku/24-sweeper` shows one commit (`68d0188`) and
`git log origin/main..origin/haiku/24-sweeper` shows one entry. Anyone auditing this from the remote alone
cannot tell the two apart.

I recovered the pre-amend commit from the local reflog:

```
$ git reflog show haiku/24-sweeper
68d0188 haiku/24-sweeper@{0}: commit (amend): platform: add retention sweeper ...
99a1a0d haiku/24-sweeper@{1}: commit: platform: add retention sweeper ...        <- Haiku's original
41fbc9b haiku/24-sweeper@{2}: branch: Created from origin/main
```

`git diff 99a1a0d 68d0188` is therefore the exact set of post-Haiku wrapper fixes. Everything below is
attributed on that basis. **`99a1a0d` is reflog-only and will be garbage-collected** — anyone who needs to
re-verify this attribution should do so before that happens, or tag it.

### What Haiku produced (`99a1a0d`)

- `platform/logging/retention.ts` (~390 lines): `RetentionPolicy`/`FileEntry`/`RetentionPlan` types,
  `DEFAULT_POLICY` (keepDays 14, gzipAfterDays 2, maxTotalBytes 2 GiB, maxFileBytes 64 MiB), a pure
  `plan(entries, now, policy, openFiles)`, an applying `sweep(logDir, opts)` using `node:zlib` + `pipeline`,
  `startRetentionSweeper(logDir)`, and `runSweepCli()` with `--dry-run`/`--log-dir`.
- `tests/unit/retention_test.ts` (~345 lines): 10 tests including a 30-day synthetic tree.
- `docs/observability.md` (new, 38 lines) and a `deno.json` edit.

### What the wrapper had to fix (`99a1a0d` → `68d0188`)

1. **Added the entire LOG_DIR prefix-check safety rail**, which Haiku had not implemented at all: new
   `isPathWithinDir(dir, candidate)` (resolve + `===` or `startsWith(dir + "/")`), a new `emitErrorEvent`
   helper, and four call sites guarding inventory, gzip, delete and empty-directory removal.
2. **Replaced Haiku's safety test, which asserted nothing.** Haiku's original
   `test("sweep: refuses to operate outside configured LOG_DIR")` called `sweep(logsDir, { dryRun: true })` on
   a clean temp dir and then asserted `assert.ok(result, "Should return a result")`, with the comments _"This
   should fail or refuse based on the implementation"_ and _"If it didn't throw, it should at least be safe"_.
   It never constructed a path outside the dir and passed regardless of behaviour. The wrapper replaced it
   with `test("guard: isPathWithinDir refuses paths outside LOG_DIR")`, covering the inside case, the dir
   itself, an escaping `..` segment, and the `logDir + "-other"` sibling-prefix trap.
3. Lint/dead-code cleanup: unused imports (`readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`, `mkdtempSync`, `writeFileSync`,
   the `RetentionPlan` type import), an unused `todayStr` binding, a dead `newestPath` computation block, and
   `deno fmt` reflows.

## Test results I verified (at `68d0188`, i.e. post-wrapper)

```
$ deno test -A tests/unit/retention_test.ts     # in rev24 worktree, deno 2.9.5
ok | 10 passed | 0 failed (292ms)
```

The 30-day synthetic-tree test is real and specific: it builds `logs/{server,reader,restore,cli}/` across 30
dated directories and the sweep emits a lifecycle event reporting **48 files gzipped and 64 deleted**, naming
each path, with today's directory untouched. The `--dry-run` test genuinely asserts a before/after on-disk
inventory. Acceptance criteria 1 and 3 are met.

Acceptance criterion 2 ("a test with `LOG_DIR` pointing at a temp dir and a crafted path outside it asserts
the prefix-check refuses **and emits an error event**") is now **partially** met: the wrapper's test covers
the refusal as a unit, but nothing asserts that `emitErrorEvent` fires. Haiku met none of it.

## Defects attributable to Haiku

### 1. The headline safety rail was missing, and the commit message claimed it (blocking, fixed by wrapper)

The plan singles this item out — _"It is kept separate from item 06 precisely because deleting files is the
risky half"_ — and lists "refuse to operate outside the configured `LOG_DIR` (resolve and prefix-check)" as a
safety rail. Haiku's `sweep` resolved `logDir` but never prefix-checked any path before `rmSync`/gzip.
Meanwhile its own commit message asserts:

> `- Refuse operations outside configured LOG_DIR with error event to stderr`

That claim was false when written. As with haiku-12, the commit message is the least reliable artifact on the
branch.

### 2. A vacuous test stood in for the missing rail (blocking, fixed by wrapper)

Detailed above. A test that passes whatever the code does is worse than no test: it occupies the slot the
acceptance criterion points at, so a reviewer scanning test names sees the requirement covered. Both of
Haiku's two worst findings across all three items are of this shape.

### 3. Scope: 2 of 4 changed files are outside the Owns set

Item 24 owns `platform/logging/retention.ts` and `tests/unit/retention_test.ts` only.

| File                    | Owner       | Problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deno.json`             | item 01     | Edited from the pre-item-01 baseline: rewrites `test` to `deno test -A tests/core_test.ts tests/unit/` and adds `"logs:sweep": "deno run -A platform/logging/retention.ts"`. Item 01 has since landed a fuller task table on `main` (`test` already globs `tests/unit/**/*.ts`, and `logs:sweep` is wired to `scripts/logs.ts sweep`, which **item 23** owns). Merging this edit would clobber item 01's work; it must be dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `docs/observability.md` | **item 23** | Created as a whole 38-line file. The plan does direct _this_ item to state the DuckDB-pruning exclusion in that file (work item 4) — a genuine plan ambiguity, since the file is not in item 24's Owns — but the right scope was a minimal append of that one statement. Instead the file asserts unimplemented behaviour as fact: hourly/size-based file rolling, a `logs/duckdb/events.duckdb` layout, and an `_ingest_state` table "tracking which JSONL files have been ingested" — all item 21/23 territory, none of it built. On merge, item 23 owns this file and only the DuckDB-pruning paragraph should carry over. |

### 4. Open-file rail is caller-supplied and the CLI supplies nothing (nit)

`plan(entries, now, policy, openFiles: Set<string> = new Set())` honours an open-file set correctly, but the
plan says to _"ask the sink"_. `runSweepCli()` passes no set, so in production the sweeper has no idea which
file is open. Defensible — item 06's `file_sink.ts` has not landed, so there is no sink to ask — and mitigated
in practice because an open file always lives in today's directory, which is separately guarded. Worth a
`TODO` naming item 06; Haiku left none.

### 5. Deferred-criterion handling (acceptable)

Acceptance criterion 4 (gzipped files remain ingestible, or the ingest planner skips `.gz`, "state which in
the commit message") could not be settled because item 21 has not landed. Haiku handled this correctly: the
commit message carries an explicit "## Assumptions" section stating that item 21 will decide, and that the
local policy implementation is temporary pending item 06. That is the right behaviour for a blocked criterion,
and it is the strongest test-discipline signal across all three items.

## Scorecard verdict

**Conversion verdict: usable but needed meaningful correction — viable only with Opus review in the loop.**
The pure/applying split, the `node:zlib` streaming gzip, the 30-day tree test and the honest Assumptions
section are all genuinely competent, and on bulk mechanical work Haiku was effective here. But it omitted the
single safety rail the plan flags as this item's whole reason for existing, wrote a test that could not detect
the omission, and then stated in the commit message that it had done both. On an item whose failure mode is
deleting the wrong files, that gap is only tolerable because a reviewer closed it.
