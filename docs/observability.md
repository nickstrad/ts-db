# Observability: the event log and how to query it

Every process in ts-db writes structured events as JSON lines. A separate step ingests those lines into an
append-only DuckDB file, and a fixed catalog of named, parameterized, read-only queries answers the usual
questions about it. This page is the reference for all three: where the files are, what the tables hold, what
each query answers, how retention works, and worked examples.

Plan references: `docs/plans/effect-port-and-observability.md` §4 (data model) and items 21–24, 35, 36.
Decisions: ADR 0004 (DuckDB only in the reader), ADR 0006 (event identity, schema v2), ADR 0007 (ingest before
retention).

## Log directory layout

`LOG_DIR` (default `./logs`):

```text
logs/
  server/2026-10-10/events-14-31887-001.jsonl       # <role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/events-<HH>-<pid>-<seq>.jsonl
  reader/2026-10-10/events-14-31902-001.jsonl
  server/2026-10-03/events-09-31010-001.jsonl.gz    # gzipped by the sweep after LOG_GZIP_AFTER_DAYS
  server/2026-10-09/rejected.jsonl                  # lines ingest could not accept, kept as evidence
  k6/<run-id>/{raw.json,summary.json}               # k6 output; loaded into k6_points by perf:ingest
```

- One file per role, process (`pid`), hour and size roll (`LOG_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, default 64 MiB; `<seq>` counts
  rolls). Files roll on date change, hour change, or size.
- The JSONL tree is the **source of truth**. The DuckDB file is derived from it and can be rebuilt by
  re-ingesting.
- The DuckDB event log is **not** under `LOG_DIR`: it is `EVENTLOG_DUCKDB`, default
  `<DATA_DIR>/eventlog.duckdb`. (The sweep never touches anything under `LOG_DIR` except event files and
  `rejected.jsonl` in the dated directories.)

JSONL records use camelCase envelope fields (`eventId`, `traceId`, `spanId`, `appId`, `kind`, …); the DuckDB
tables use snake_case. See `core/events.ts` for the record shapes.

## Tables

The schema is **v2** (`core/eventlog/ddl.ts`, ADR 0006). Event tables are append-only: ingest only ever
`INSERT`s into them. `_ingest_state` is the single mutable table. Every typed event table carries `event_id`,
and a record of that kind lands in both `platform_events` (under its `event_kind`) and its typed table under
the **same** `event_id`.

Not every table has every correlation column: `queue_events`, `backup_events` and `lifecycle_events` have no
`trace_id`, and `queue_events` has no `app_id`. Queries that need those columns can only use the tables that
carry them.

### `platform_events`

Every record of every kind, one row each. The place for cross-kind questions and the only table with span
identity.

| `detail`   | JSON      | Phase-specific payload (what a sweep gzipped and deleted, …). |

### `k6_points`

One row per k6 data point. Filled by `deno task perf:ingest` from `logs/k6/<run-id>/raw.json`, **not** by
event-log ingest, and not a projection of an event record (so it has no `event_id`). Empty until a k6 run has
been loaded.

| Column     | Type      | Meaning                                                |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ts`       | TIMESTAMP | The point's time, UTC.                                 |
| `run_id`   | VARCHAR   | The k6 run id (`logs/k6/<run-id>`).                    |
| `metric`   | VARCHAR   | k6 metric name, e.g. `http_req_duration`.              |
| `value`    | DOUBLE    | The point's value (milliseconds for duration metrics). |
| `scenario` | VARCHAR   | k6 scenario name.                                      |
| `status`   | VARCHAR   | HTTP status tag.                                       |
| `trace_id` | VARCHAR   | The `X-Trace-Id` the VU sent, when tagged.             |
| `tags`     | JSON      | All k6 tags.                                           |

### `_ingest_state`

The ingest watermark: one row per JSONL source file. Retention reads it as its ledger.

| Column             | Type      | Meaning                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source_file`      | VARCHAR   | Path relative to `LOG_DIR`. Primary key.                                         |
| `bytes_ingested`   | BIGINT    | Bytes of the file ingested; always ends just past a `\n`.                        |
| `prefix_sha256`    | VARCHAR   | SHA-256 of exactly those bytes. A mismatch means the file was rewritten.         |
| `last_ingested_at` | TIMESTAMP | When this row was last advanced, UTC.                                            |
| `dedupe`           | BOOLEAN   | Set once a rewrite was detected: every later line is deduplicated on `event_id`. |

### `_eventlog_schema`

Which schema version the file holds, one row per way it got there.

| Column       | Type      | Meaning                                     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `version`    | INTEGER   | Schema version (2 for this build).          |
| `applied_at` | TIMESTAMP | When it was applied, UTC.                   |
| `method`     | VARCHAR   | `create`, or `rebuild-from-v1`.             |
| `detail`     | JSON      | The rebuild's evidence, when there was one. |

A v2 build refuses a v1 (unversioned) file rather than reuse its tables; `upgradeEventLog`
(`platform/eventlog/tables.ts`) rebuilds it from the retained JSONL.

## Running things

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.deno/bin:$PATH"
deno task logs:ingest                 # JSONL -> DuckDB, idempotent
deno task logs:list                   # the catalog's names and questions
deno task logs:query <name> [--param k=v]... [--format table|json|csv]
deno task logs:sweep [--dry-run]      # ingest, seal torn tails, then retention
```

- `logs:query` opens the event-log file **read-only**. DuckDB allows one writer: while the reader process or a
  `logs:ingest` holds the file, the query fails with an `AnalysisError` that quotes the lock error. Run
  queries between ingests, or ask the running server (`POST /admin/logs/analysis/:name`).
- `--param` is repeatable and every value is bound as a typed parameter; there is no way to supply SQL. An
  unknown parameter, or a missing required one, is an `AnalysisError` naming the accepted parameters.
- An unknown query name exits **2** with `UnknownAnalysisQuery` and the list of valid names. Any other failure
  exits 1.
- Parameters shared by most queries: `since` (inclusive) and `until` (exclusive), ISO-8601 timestamps (UTC
  when no offset is given); `appId`; `limit`.

## Named queries

The catalog lives in `platform/analysis/catalog.ts` as a plain record of `{ sql, params, description }`. It is
**extensible**: a new query is one more entry (the tenant-aware `error-rate-by-tenant`, for example, will be
added that way). This section and the catalog are kept in step by `tests/unit/analysis_catalog_test.ts`, which
fails if a name or parameter is documented here and absent there, or the reverse. Every entry is a single
`SELECT`/`WITH`, also asserted by that test.

### `deadline-hits-per-handler-hour`

**Question:** how many statements hit their deadline per app, handler and UTC hour? Returns `hour`, `app_id`,
`handler_kind`, `name`, `path` and `deadline_hits`. Joins deadline-tagged `sql_events` to the nearest
completing request by trace, app and request time window (one match per SQL event, including millisecond
timestamp rounding at both window boundaries). Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId` (all optional). Failed
statements are logged even without `TRACE_SQL`; execution paths in older JSONL are NULL. Ingest adds the
nullable `path` column to existing v2 event logs.

### `slowest-sql`

**Question:** what are the p50/p95/p99 `duration_ms` by engine, statement kind and table? Ordered by p95,
slowest first. Also counts calls and errors. Source: `sql_events`, which the server only writes when
`TRACE_SQL=true` (or `LOG_LEVEL=debug`); without it this query returns no rows. Parameters: `since`, `until`,
`appId`, `limit` (default 100).

### `plan-shapes`

**Question:** which distinct compiled SQL texts actually run, how often, and how fast — and so whether the
indexes the schema declares are helping? One row per `(engine, statement_kind, table, sql_text)` with calls,
average/p95/max latency and row counts. A shape with a high `avg_rows` and high latency is a candidate for an
index; a shape that never appears is a plan the app never uses. Source: `sql_events`, so it needs
`TRACE_SQL=true` like `slowest-sql`. Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId`, `limit` (default 50).

### `error-rate-by-handler`

**Question:** per app and handler, how many requests were there, what fraction failed, and which error tags
made up the failures? A request failed when `status >= 400` or it has an `error_tag`. `error_tags` reads like
`MutationError:3, SchemaError:1`. Source: `http_events`. Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId`, `limit`
(default 100).

### `mutation-vs-query-latency`

**Question:** how do the writer path (`handler_kind = 'mutation'`) and the reader path (`'query'`) compare in
latency over time? One row per time bucket and kind with p50/p95/p99. Source: `platform_events` where
`event_kind = 'handler'`. Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId`, `bucketSeconds` (default 60), `limit`
(default 500).

### `handler-throughput`

**Question:** how many requests per minute does each handler serve, and what is the status breakdown
(2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx)? Source: `http_events`. Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId`, `limit` (default 500).

### `queue-depth`

**Question:** how deep did the writer and reader queues get, and were requests rejected or log records
dropped? Per bucket and queue: maximum depth, capacity, counts of `high-water`, `rejected` and `dropped`
events, and records dropped. Source: `queue_events` (no `app_id`, so no `appId` parameter). Parameters:
`since`, `until`, `bucketSeconds` (default 60), `limit` (default 500).

### `tx-outcomes`

**Question:** how many transactions committed, rolled back or were interrupted, and how long did they wait in
the writer queue? Per app, engine and outcome. Source: `tx_events`. Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId`,
`limit` (default 100).

### `backup-history`

**Question:** per app, which backup phases ran, how long did each take, which failed, and how long was it
between successful backups? Lists the orchestration phases (`emitter = 'backups'`); a run succeeded when its
`publish-latest` phase did, and that row carries `gap_since_previous_success`. Source: `backup_events`.
Parameters: `since`, `until`, `appId`, `limit` (default 200).

### `trace`

**Question:** what is the complete, ordered event timeline for one `trace_id`, across both processes? Rows
from `platform_events`, `sql_events`, `tx_events`, `http_events` and `k6_points` that share the trace id,
ordered by `ts`; a `source` column says which table each came from and `role` says which process wrote
platform events. Typed events (`http`, `sql`, `tx`) are listed once, from their typed table, not twice.
`queue_events`, `backup_events` and `lifecycle_events` have no `trace_id` and so are not part of a trace.
Parameters: `traceId` (**required**), `limit` (default 1000).

### `k6-vs-platform`

**Question:** how does the k6 client's p95 `http_req_duration` compare to the server's handler p95 per
10-second bucket per scenario? The difference is transport and queueing outside the handler. Source:
`k6_points` joined to `http_events`. Returns no rows until `deno task perf:ingest` has loaded a k6 run.
Parameters: `runId`, `limit` (default 500).

## Retention

Retention applies to the **JSONL tree**. It is **ingest-gated**: a source file is gzipped or deleted only
after a _committed_ ingest watermark (`_ingest_state`) covers the file's full tail, with a matching hash. A
file that is open, unsettled, changed since it was inventoried, or not fully accounted for is pinned: kept,
still counted toward the size cap, and reported as `blocked`.

Defaults (environment variables):

| Setting               | Default            | Meaning                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LOG_GZIP_AFTER_DAYS` | 7                  | Gzip a closed, ingested file after this many days.     |
| `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`  | 30                 | Delete a closed, ingested file after this many days.   |
| `LOG_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` | 1073741824 (1 GiB) | Cap on the retained JSONL; oldest safe files go first. |
| `LOG_MAX_FILE_BYTES`  | 67108864 (64 MiB)  | Roll to a new file past this size.                     |

Rules that always hold: today's directory (and anything dated later) and any file a sink holds open are never
touched; every path must resolve strictly inside `LOG_DIR` with the shape
`<role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/events-<HH>-<pid>-<seq>.jsonl[.gz]`; gzip is written to a temp file, verified by
decompress-and-hash, then renamed before the source is removed. A gzipped file stays ingestible: it
decompresses to exactly the bytes ingest committed, and its `_ingest_state` row is kept.

### Ordering: `ingestThenSweep`

`ingestThenSweep` in `platform/eventlog/ingest.ts` is the coordinator that enforces the gate:

1. **Ingest** commits first.
2. **Torn tails are sealed** (a closed file's last, unterminated line is moved to quarantine so the file can
   be accounted for).
3. **The sweep plans** from the committed `_ingest_state` rows as its ledger, then applies.

An ingest failure fails the whole call before anything is swept. A sweep failure is reported in the result
(`retention.status = "failed"`), not as an ingest error.

`deno task logs:sweep` runs `ingestThenSweep()`. `deno task logs:sweep --dry-run` runs
`ingestThenSweep({ dryRun: true })`: it plans the sweep from the **already-committed** state and reports it,
changing nothing — no ingest, no sealing, no file touched (and, when it succeeds, no event emitted). The
reader process runs the same coordinator when `POST /admin/logs/ingest` is called.

### The DuckDB file is not pruned

Retention does not prune the DuckDB event log. The file **grows with every ingested event** until an explicit
future `logs:compact` command exists (out of scope for this phase). Its size is reported next to the JSONL
budget (`budgets.derived.duckdbBytes`) but is not bounded by `LOG_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`. Because the JSONL is the
source of truth, deleting the file and re-ingesting rebuilds it from whatever JSONL is still retained.

## Worked examples

Generate load and ingest it:

```sh
TRACE_SQL=true bash work-scripts/bash/k6-scenario-run.sh perf:mixed my-run   # throwaway server, k6 -> logs/k6/my-run
deno task logs:ingest
deno task logs:list
```

### "Show me everything that happened for trace id X"

Send a request with your own trace id (or take one from a response's `X-Trace-Id` header or a log line),
ingest, then ask for the trace:

```sh
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/apps/tic-tac-toe/mutation/createGame" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer dev-only" -H 'x-trace-id: demo-trace-1' \
  -d '{"xPlayer":"a","oPlayer":"b"}'
deno task logs:ingest
deno task logs:query trace --param traceId=demo-trace-1
deno task logs:query trace --param traceId=demo-trace-1 --format json | jq '.[] | {ts, source, role, kind, name, outcome}'
```

The result is the whole request in time order: the server's `http` record and handler, the SQLite `sql` and
`tx` events of a mutation, then — for a query — the reader process's own events with `role = reader`, whose
`parent_span_id` is the server handler's `span_id`. A rolled-back mutation shows `outcome = rollback` and its
`error_tag` on the `tx` row.

If it returns no rows, either the event has not been ingested yet (`logs:ingest`) or the id is wrong; ids
longer than 128 characters or containing unsafe characters are replaced at ingress, and the replacement is
what the response echoes.

### Which handlers fail, and how?

```

### What did the last backup cost, and how long since the last success?

```sh
deno task logs:query backup-history --param appId=tic-tac-toe
```

### Preview what retention would do

## Starter SQL for the `duckdb` CLI

`scripts/duckdb/*.sql` are ad-hoc `duckdb`-CLI versions of a few of these queries, written against the same v2
columns (see `scripts/duckdb/README.md`). The catalog is the supported interface; those files are for
exploration.
