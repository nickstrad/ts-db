/**
 * The tic-tac-toe rules, as pure functions (plan item 10, work 3).
 *
 * This module is PURE in the same sense as `core/`: it imports `effect`, the pure `RuleError`
 * class from `core/errors.ts`, and types only — no `Effect`, no `sdk/` runtime, no `platform/`,
 * no `Deno.*`, no I/O. Every rejection is a `RuleError` in the left channel of an `Either`, so
 * the whole game can be exercised without a database (`tests/unit/rules_test.ts`, and the
 * property suite in item 12).
 *
 * Note on the type parameter order: the plan writes `applyMove`'s signature error-first
 * (`Either<RuleError, …>`), but Effect 3's `Either` is value-first — `Either<A, E>`. The code
 * below uses the real Effect order, as `core/schema.ts` does.
 *
 * The rules themselves are carried over from the pre-port `app/functions.ts` unchanged, including
 * the order in which they reject (game over, then turn ownership, then the cell) and the fact that
 * the turn flips even on the move that ends the game.
