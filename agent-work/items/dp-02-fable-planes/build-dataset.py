"""Author DP-02 only: the Fable revision of the planes dataset.

Part A below is the DP-01 generator (agent-work/items/dp-01-planes/build-dataset.py) verbatim except for the
dataset identity, output paths and source pins; run on its own it reproduces tsdb-planes-proposal byte for byte
after deno fmt, which is how "carried over unchanged" is kept honest. Part B applies modifications M1–M8 from
docs/architecture/scale-out-comparison-fable.md. Part C orders, links, trailers and writes the bundle and the
inventory. Run from the repository root; format outputs with deno fmt --config deno.json.

AVAILABILITY = """Chosen availability policy: fail closed for ALL new admissions when control-plane authority cannot be confirmed. There is no offline lease or heartbeat authorization. Decision issuance is the admission point; no decision prefetch or reuse is permitted. Every request, including an existing session, needs an online one-request admission decision from the authority, bound to database ID, owner epoch/generation, principal, permission, request ID and a deadline of at most 30 seconds. Agent checks that decision and its durable local ACTIVE epoch/fence. A decision is consumed once; it cannot open an offline session. Revocation denies subsequent decisions; a decision already issued may execute until its deadline, and already-running work settles or is cancelled by its deadline. Lifecycle fences override outstanding decisions locally.

| State / event | Admission / recovery |
| --- | --- |
| Authority reachable, database ACTIVE | Online authorization and current epoch plus durable local ACTIVE state required for each request. |
| Authority unavailable, running agent | Reject new requests, including existing sessions. Already admitted work settles within its deadline; no transfer. |
| MOVING, SUSPENDED, DROPPING or durable local fence | Reject admission even with a previously issued decision. No ownership transfer without confirmed source fencing. |
| Agent restart | Keep closed. Terminate and confirm exit of orphan workers before opening files. Reconcile committed owner/epoch/generation and durable fences online; unavailable authority means stay closed. |
| Controller crash after placement commit, before activation ACK | Target remains sole committed owner; it stays closed until idempotent activation reconciles that commit. Source stays fenced. Never roll back to stale ownership. |

Serialize lifecycle operations per database. Every command carries database ID, operation ID, expected owner epoch and generation, and intended transition. Persist accepted transition/fence and its acknowledgement before replying. Replay returns recorded status; reject superseded activation, unfence and delete commands. Cleanup names the exact old generation and operation: a delayed A-to-B delete cannot delete A's later active generation after B-to-A. Recheck these preconditions before filesystem effects, not only on receipt."""

Bind it to the database ID, owner epoch, generation, principal, permission, request ID and a deadline no more than 30 seconds away. Use it once. Check the local durable ACTIVE state and fence too. Reject new decisions after permission revocation. An issued decision can run until its deadline. A local fence blocks it immediately.

| State / event | Required action |

GRANTS_TABLE = """Chosen availability policy (M1, replaces DP-01's single-use decision per request): the routing authority issues a route grant per (gateway, database ID) bound to the owner VM, epoch and generation, the principal's grant version and a TTL of 30 s. The gateway reuses a grant for any number of requests until it expires, WrongOwner invalidates it or a grant-version bump revokes it. Every request still carries the grant's epoch and generation; the agent checks them against its durable local ACTIVE epoch and fence, and that check is what prevents stale execution. New grants fail closed when the authority is unreachable. A stale-route retry obtains a fresh decision bound to the new epoch. There is no lease and no clock in the fencing argument. Revocation takes effect within the TTL, the same 30 s bound DP-01 had.

| State / event | Admission / recovery |
| --- | --- |
| Authority reachable, database ACTIVE | A valid grant (unexpired, matching grant version) plus the agent's durable local ACTIVE state and matching epoch, for each request. |
| Authority unavailable, running agent | Existing grants serve until their TTL; no new grants. After the TTL the gateway fails closed. Already admitted work settles within its deadline; no transfer. |
| MOVING, SUSPENDED, DROPPING or durable local fence | Reject admission even with a valid grant: the local fence overrides. WrongOwner invalidates the gateway's grant. No ownership transfer without confirmed source fencing. |
| Agent restart | Keep closed. Terminate and confirm exit of orphan workers before opening files. Reconcile committed owner/epoch/generation and durable fences online; unavailable authority means stay closed. |
| Controller crash after placement commit, before activation ACK | Target remains sole committed owner; it stays closed until idempotent activation reconciles that commit. Source stays fenced. Never roll back to stale ownership. |

Serialize lifecycle operations per database. Every command carries database ID, operation ID, expected owner epoch and generation, and intended transition. Persist accepted transition/fence and its acknowledgement before replying. Replay returns recorded status; reject superseded activation, unfence and delete commands. Cleanup names the exact old generation and operation: a delayed A-to-B delete cannot delete A's later active generation after B-to-A. Recheck these preconditions before filesystem effects, not only on receipt."""
STE_GRANTS_TABLE = """Policy: the authority gives the gateway a route grant for each database. The grant names the owner VM, epoch, generation, grant version and a 30-second time limit. Reuse it for many requests until it expires, until WrongOwner invalidates it, or until the authority revokes it. Each request carries the epoch and generation. The agent checks them against its durable local state and fence. If the authority is not reachable, do not issue new grants. After a stale route, obtain a fresh decision for the new epoch. There is no lease.

| State / event | Required action |
| --- | --- |
| ACTIVE and authority available | Check the grant and its time limit, then the local state and epoch, for each request. |

          '- **F1 / M1 — route grants with a TTL.** New component `grant-cache` (data plane) and document `doc-grant-cache`; relationships `dp-grant` (authorization ↔ cache) and `dp-revoke` (router → cache, best effort); relabelled `dp-route`, `dp-forward`, `dp-owner`, `c-resolve`, `c-forward`. The DP-01 availability table ("online one-request decision, no reuse") is replaced in `doc-node-admission`, `doc-placement-router`, `doc-flow-move-database` and `doc-flow-move-failed` by the grant table (row "Authority unavailable, running agent" → "existing grants serve until their TTL; no new grants"). `flow-query-right-node` is the grant-miss path, new `flow-query-grant-reuse` is the steady state with no control-plane call, and `flow-query-stale` states that a stale-route retry obtains a **fresh decision** bound to the new epoch (closing the re-review\'s residual nit). The agent\'s check of grant epoch/generation against its durable local ACTIVE state remains the enforcement point; there is no lease and no clock in the fencing argument. Term `term-route-grant`.',
          '- **F2 / M2 — build order.** Document `doc-build-order` (on `planes-context` and `planes-lane-components`): in-node half first on one VM keyed by database_id, then schema + default database, then gateway + grants + forwarder, then lifecycle/backup/recovery; the lanes acceptance tests re-targeted to databases and the 4.1 ms / +2 ms gate. No diagram change: sequencing is not architecture.',
          '- **F3 / M3 — the lane view inside the agent.** New component view `planes-lane-components` (scope `lanes`, child of `planes-agent-components`) importing the lanes proposal\'s lane components re-keyed by database: `lane-ipc`, `lane-scheduler` (mixed: Semaphore(1) per file and WRITER_QUEUE_CAP are landed), `lane-handles` (mixed: the 64-entry leased cache is landed), `lane-request-ids`, `lane-snapshot` (new: backups on a read-only connection, off the writer lock; today `Storage.snapshot` runs on the writer queue), plus the carried `classifier`, `execution`, `deadline`. Relationships `ln-*`. Lane assignment is tenant-affine by default and placement may pin a database to a lane (noted in `doc-node-admission`, `doc-metadata`, `doc-lanes`). `doc-lane-measurements` carries the lanes PoC numbers with provenance and the statement that they do not measure this design. The lanes logger / JSONL are deliberately not imported: observability stays omitted as in DP-01 DP10.',
          '- **F4 / M4 — default database and selection surface.** `doc-ingress`, `doc-authorization`, `doc-placement-router`, `doc-caller`, `doc-database-registry` gain the selection contract: `database` option per session or per call, tenant-scoped name, none → reserved `default`, name → immutable ID resolved under the trusted tenant and stamped into the operation IR after authorization; the classifier and agent never see a name. Migration: each existing tenant file becomes its tenant\'s `default` (minted ID, placement row owner = the one node, epoch 1); `ControlPlaneRouter` becomes `resolve(databaseId)` with `TenantContext` extended. Schema question: Fable\'s default is a per-database schema fingerprint, not yet decided. Term `term-default-database`. Step 1 of the query flows names the default.',
          '- **F5 / M5 — VM loss end to end.** New person `platform-operator` and external system `provider`; relationships `ctx-attest`, `ctx-provider`, `c-attest`, `c-provider`, `cp-attest`, `cp-recover`, `cp-suspect`, `cp-provider`, `cp-backup-delete`. Flows `flow-recover-from-loss` (detection → attestation → provider proof recorded → per database CAS to FENCED-BY-OPERATOR at a fresh epoch → restore from the latest recorded manifest onto an eligible VM → verify → CAS ACTIVE → activate), `flow-recover-refused` (no attestation → refused; databases stay unavailable) and `flow-drop-lost-agent` (lifecycle identity deletes backup objects only once the VM is attested lost). Standing rule in every one of them: inability to contact the old writer is never permission to activate a copy. Recovery point is the backup interval; this is not automatic failover. Term `term-attestation`. DP-01 tweak 6\'s deferral text is replaced by a closure note in `doc-backups`, `doc-lifecycle-policies`, `doc-planes-control-components`, `doc-flow-drop-database`, `doc-flow-drop-failed`.',
          '- **F6 / M6 — backup completion as a recorded manifest.** New component `backup-registry` (control plane), relationships `cp-manifest`, `cp-manifests-sql`; flows `flow-backup-manifest` (snapshot off the writer lock → immutable PUT → read-back verify → acknowledgement carries the manifest → recorded, keyed by (database ID, generation) → eligible for restore) and `flow-backup-unverified` (no manifest, not a candidate). Term `term-backup-manifest`. The landed pipeline in `platform/backup.ts` is the mechanism, re-keyed.',
          '- **F7 / M7 — instance-level move diagrams.** `flow-move-instances` and `flow-move-failed-instances` (children of `planes-deployment`, linked from the logical move flows and back) with instance participants `dep-control`, `dep-metadata`, `dep-a-agent`, `dep-b-agent`. New instance relationship `dep-a-agent-to-dep-b-agent` for the A → B snapshot stream, following the lanes dataset\'s P16 node-to-node forward: an instance edge with no container-level self-relationship and therefore no `modelRelationshipId` (the only deployment-tier edge without one; every other `dep-*` edge still names its logical relationship). c4-sdk permits deployment instances only in deployment views, so the companions are illustrative deployment views (not dynamic step trees) whose documents and this inventory carry the ordered sequence; the step trees stay on the logical flows. The DP-01 repair\'s checkpoint ordering is kept step for step. DP-01 tweak 7\'s deferral text is replaced by a closure note in both logical move documents.',
          '- **F8 / M8 — candidate v1 placement rule, pending Nick\'s decision.** New component `placement-policy` (control plane) and relationship `cp-policy`; two steps inserted into `flow-create-database`. Its documents say **proposed, pending Nick\'s decision** and that the registry keeps placement policy OPEN until he decides; the addendum\'s prohibition on inventing a solved mechanism is respected by labelling, not by omission. Rule: among eligible VMs, lowest descriptor-weighted load (capacity nofile − reserve; 3 descriptors per writer, 2 per pooled reader; size tiebreak); weights and locality open.',
          '- **F9 — sources and pins.** Every carried-over source is re-pinned to `main` at `3d25004` (all paths exist there; nothing under `core/`, `platform/` or `sdk/` changed since `2d30330`). DP-01\'s brief, addendum and review are `src-dp01-*`; `src-brief` is the DP-02 brief at its own commit `b2b65b0`; the DP-01 addendum needs no SHA-256 special case because it is now on `main`. Every element, relationship, diagram and document also cites `src-planes` and `src-comparison`.',
          '- **F10 — mixed-tier edge numbers.** Fable flows that mix container-tier `c-` and component-tier `cp-` relationships (backup and recovery) show a container edge as 100 + its container number so per-diagram display numbers stay unique while remaining model references; `c-node-backup` is also drawn that way in the control-plane view. Carried-over diagrams keep DP-01\'s numbers.',
          '- **F11 — what did not change.** Registries, epoch-checked and per-database serialised lifecycle commands, the trust boundary, bounded scheduling keyed by database with tenant/VM ceilings, the offline move protocol and its fencing rule, drop/tombstone semantics, status marking (`existing` classifier/execution, `mixed` deadline/placement-router, all processes `planned`) and the illustrative deployment are carried over unchanged.
