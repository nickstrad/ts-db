# FFI-07 — Property tests for the binding and the deadline (builder brief)

Status: dispatched · Branch: `item/ffi-07-props` · Worktree: `/root/Software/tsdb-work/ffi07` · Base: `main` at
`f2bf1c9` (FFI-05 merge) · Builder: Claude Sonnet (actor `claude-sonnet-ffi-07`) · Reviewer: Astra (`gpt-6-astra`),
fresh unit · Date: 2026-10-14 · Runs CONCURRENT with FFI-06 (`item/ffi-06-evidence`, disjoint Owns).

Plan: `git show origin/plan/ffi-implementation:docs/plans/ffi-implementation.md` — read §1.2, §2, §3 and FFI-07 in §4.
Also read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `agent-work/event-log.md` (log `task_started` first with
`work-scripts/bash/log-event.sh --actor claude-sonnet-ffi-07 --branch item/ffi-07-props --type task_started --summary
"FFI-07 …"`), `docs/knowledge/index.md`, `docs/knowledge/gotchas.md` (FFI entries, "seed sweep", "Exit-139"),
`docs/testing.md`, `platform/sqlite_ffi/README.md`, `tests/property/sqlite_oracle_test.ts` and
`tests/property/arbitraries.ts` (generators to reuse), `tests/property/json_number_test.ts`,
`tests/unit/nul_contract_test.ts`, `tests/unit/sqlite_ffi_crud_test.ts` and `sqlite_ffi_cancel_test.ts` (what the
unit tests already pin), `tests/unit/ffi_classify_test.ts` (FFI-05 landed the classifier property there).

## Why

FFI-01..05 are unit-tested; this item adds the generator-driven invariants the plan relies on for crash-safety and
contract claims: value round trips through the binding against a `node:sqlite` oracle, interrupt totality, and the
classifier property if FFI-05's unit test does not already cover it.

## Owns

`tests/property/ffi_roundtrip_test.ts` (new), `tests/property/ffi_interrupt_test.ts` (new), `docs/testing.md`
(additive rows), `tests/unit/boundaries_test.ts` (ONLY the `node:sqlite` test allow-list: add your round-trip file by
exact path with a one-line justification; no other change), `agent-work/items/ffi-07-props/*` (`git add -f`). Nothing else: not `deno.json` (frozen — the
`test:prop` task globs `tests/property/`; confirm your files are picked up), not `platform/**`, not FFI-06's files
(`perf/*`, `tests/integration.ts`, `core/events.ts`, `core/eventlog/*`, `platform/eventlog/*`,
`platform/analysis/*`, `work-scripts/INDEX.md`), not any other worktree.

## The one rule (plan §1.2)

Never open the same file through `node:sqlite` and the binding in one process. The oracle runs on its own
`:memory:` database; the binding runs on its own temp file. The boundary test (`tests/unit/boundaries_test.ts`)
allow-lists which test files may import `node:sqlite` by exact path; the coordinator has pre-extended your Owns to
that one list so you can add `tests/property/ffi_roundtrip_test.ts` to it (exact path, one-line justification, the
same style as the four existing entries). Touch nothing else in that file.

## Work

1. Round trip (`ffi_roundtrip_test.ts`): for generated values of every column kind — text with U+0000 and lone
   surrogates, integers across the full int64 range (`bigint` under `readBigInts`), doubles including `-0`, `NaN`
   rejected as a typed error, blobs including empty — `bind → step → column` through the binding equals what
   `node:sqlite` returns for the same bind on a SEPARATE in-memory database — except U+0000 text, where the binding
   returns the full string and `node:sqlite` the truncated one; pin that difference explicitly (ADR 0005). Use
   `tests/property/arbitraries.ts` generators where they fit; fixed seed like the other property files (`seed=20261010`
   style) with the run count in the test name.
2. Interrupt totality (`ffi_interrupt_test.ts`): for random statements (long recursive CTEs, large scans over a
   seeded table, trivial point reads) and random interrupt delays 0–50 ms, a nonblocking step (`allAsync` with
   `timeoutMs` and/or `AbortSignal`) always terminates with either rows or `SqliteCancelled`, never hangs (bound each
   iteration with a generous outer wall-clock guard that FAILS the test if hit), and the connection answers the next
   statement; 200 iterations. Mind the gotchas entry from FFI-05: `sqlite3_interrupt` does not cut a `busy_timeout`
   wait — do not generate statements that block on a lock, or treat `SQLITE_BUSY` as a valid terminal outcome and say
   so.
3. Classifier property: FFI-05 landed `tests/unit/ffi_classify_test.ts` with a 2 000-plan property. Read it; if it
   already asserts `bounded ⇔ (_id eq filter present ∧ no aggregate)` over generated `SelectPlan`s, do not duplicate;
   add a row to `docs/testing.md` pointing at it. Otherwise add the property to `ffi_roundtrip_test.ts`'s sibling
   file set as `tests/property/ffi_classify_props.ts` (then that file is in your Owns too).
4. `docs/testing.md`: additive rows for the new suites (what they pin, seed, run count, how to sweep).

## Acceptance evidence

- `deno task test:prop` green with the new suites; `deno task lint`, `check`, `test` green; `deno fmt --check` on
  owned files. A 200-seed sweep with `work-scripts/bash/property-seed-sweep.sh` on your two files (read the script
  and gotchas "seed sweep" for usage) finds no failure other than known exit-139 reruns; record the sweep summary in
  the commit body. Known timing flakes under load, not blockers: `tests/unit/ipc_test.ts:663`,
  `number_dialects_test.ts:243`, `sqlite_ffi_cancel_test.ts:76`. Never run suites concurrently with another suite
  (`tests/unit/tenants_test.ts` shares the dev Postgres) — FFI-06 is building at the same time, so check
  `pgrep -af "deno test"` before starting a suite and wait if one is running; your seed sweep should target only
  your own files, not the whole suite.

## Protocol

One implementation commit `tests: add FFI round-trip and interrupt-totality properties` (body: generators, seeds,
sweep result, the pinned NUL difference). Separate `agent-work: add FFI-07 brief` commit (`git add -f
agent-work/items/ffi-07-props/`). Knowledge in its own commit if durable. Push `item/ffi-07-props` to origin; do not
merge or touch `main`; do not edit FFI-06's files or worktree. Log `task_completed` naming validation and SHAs. Final
output: commit SHAs, per-task pass/fail counts, sweep summary, any blocker (boundary allow-list), learning assessment,
what the reviewer should look at first.
