# DP-01 builder report

Date: 2026-10-20. Actor: `sol-dp-01`. Branch: `item/dp-01-planes`. Worktree retained at
`/root/Software/tsdb-work/dp01`. No main merge or deployment. The required `agent-work/COORDINATION.md` is
absent in this checkout; the shared event inbox and the other orientation files were read.

Brief commit: `6c3989e28aed5c5fa60d4f6c33730ce6885d5c9a`. Implementation: the commit containing this report;
the completion event and final response supply its exact SHA without a self-referential commit hash.

## Delivered

`tsdb-planes-proposal` adds 44 elements, 54 relationships, 59 plain + STE draft documents and 14 diagrams. The
inventory maps every element, relationship, scenario root and interaction to its sources and documents.

All dynamic views are ordered `scenario: Step` trees reusing static model relationships, with responses
represented by reverse interactions. Failure alternatives have separate names and diagrams. No measured
performance or production deployment claims are made.

## Registration and scope

The dropdown is data-driven, but a bundle alone is insufficient: `pages/public/catalog.json` lists its
entries. Added exactly one entry and kept `tsdb-current` as default. This is the minimal registration change
explicitly required by Build §8; the initial Owns list omitted that registration file. No viewer code changed.
The existing fixtures still exercise a separate three-entry catalog and an arbitrary default; production now
has three real entries. Per-dataset catalog assertions were extended, scenario integrity checks now cover both
proposals, and browser smoke renders all 14 new diagrams and switches to the new entry and Back.

README edits stay in the dataset/catalog description. Both existing bundles and their content trees are
byte-identical against baseline `351a51b`; checksum evidence follows in the acceptance section.

## Design decisions and reuse

- A tenant owns 0..N databases. Immutable database IDs key placement, isolation, files, backups, queues and
  lifecycle. Names resolve within the trusted tenant; they never become paths. Database selection shares one
  session/endpoint across nodes.
- Postgres metadata uses hand-written SQL, no ORM. Durable operation records coordinate SQL and file/RPC work
  through reconciliation. Tenant deletion is restricted until all its databases finish deletion.
- The landed routing seam is **mixed**, not an already built remote router. Its current tenant-only
  `resolve(tenantId)` requires an explicit database-aware context/selection extension. Swapping location
  resolution remains behind the seam; current clients do not already have an arbitrary-database API.
- Reuse the lanes proposal’s placement epochs, forwarding, supervisor, child-process statement lanes,
  request-ID deduplication, and FFI classifier/deadline vocabulary. The FFI binding and IR classifier code are
  **existing**; lanes and database-aware remote behavior are **planned**. Deadline policy is **mixed** because
  supervisor escalation is proposed. Pass operation IR alongside compiled SQL/binds to preserve the landed
  classifier contract.
- Move is explicitly offline per database: record MOVING, deny new opens, fence admissions including existing
  sessions, drain/cancel work, close handles, checkpoint/copy/verify, and only then atomically publish the new
  owner and epoch. Require source fence acknowledgement; no automatic failover from an unreachable source.
  Target activation checks the committed placement. Confirm process exit after a lane kill. Before-flip
  rollback requires intact source and confirmed target cleanup; after-flip recovery reconciles the new owner.
- Drop removes file/sidecars, staged/source copies and backups/archived WAL before registry cleanup. Keep
  non-routable ID tombstones and durable operation audit. Failed cleanup remains unavailable and pending.
  Suspend/resume and backup/restore policies are documented on the lifecycle component.
- Deliberately drop tenant-sticky lane sets, tenant-wide files/queues/locks and unchanged DuckDB/observability
  detail. Defer online WAL streaming; verified database snapshots suffice for the chosen move protocol. Child
  processes contain failures, but killing a shared lane can affect several databases’ in-flight work.
- Context keeps standard C4 abstraction: two labelled paths into one system; the container view splits the
  control plane, data plane and hosting fleet. Supporting internal components are grey to meet SDK grammar,
  and the key explains their ownership. No library is invented as a container.

## Visual inspection

Captured and inspected desktop canvases at 1600×1000 and the container view at 390×844. Shortened card
summaries while retaining full explanations, and changed main views to left-to-right for a clearer overview.
The context, container, both component views, move flow and illustrative deployment have committed screenshots
under `screenshots/`. The mobile document width is 390 with scroll width 390: no page-wide overflow.

The existing viewer opens at actual size and offers Fit, zoom and pan. Fit makes large views an overview; use
actual size/zoom and the explanation panel to read detail, especially on mobile. No viewer changes were made.
Screenshots capture Fit views; full plain and STE text remains available in the inspector.

## Validation history

The first decoder check found one missing accent swatch in the new context legend; fixed it. The first full
Pages check then passed 162 unit tests and 26 browser tests. During visual refinements, I accidentally ran two
checks against the same preview port: one collided with the occupied port, and the overlapping build also
interrupted one diagram load in the other run. Final acceptance runs serially against the completed dataset;
no checks or timeouts were weakened. Final outputs are below.

## Learning assessment and reviewer handoff

Durable findings are preserved inside the authorized inventory (DP4 router truth, DP7 fencing/relocation, DP9
lane blast radius). Coordinator: link the inventory from `docs/knowledge/index.md` and `decisions.md` after
review; those files are outside builder ownership. No general reusable script was found. The unit-only
`build-dataset.py` preserves the authored dataset source; run it from this worktree and format the two outputs
with the root Deno config. It pins the brief commit and baseline explicitly.

Ready for the specified independent Astra design review and one fresh Sol repair round if requested. Review
focus: database-aware API seam, relocation fencing and recovery ordering, all-data drop semantics, and the
chosen C4 context abstraction. This report is the builder’s handoff, not an independent PASS verdict.

## Final acceptance outputs

Commands run with the brief’s Node/Deno PATH and HOME=/root.

## Addendum 1 — applied 2026-10-20

Actor: `sol-dp-01-addendum`. Applied on top of implementation `db0bb43617fac36127b99e1d312c3e0900f609f2` in
the explicitly assigned existing worktree. The one addendum commit contains this section; its completion event
supplies the SHA. Branch remains `item/dp-01-planes`.

The control plane now owns routing logic and the placement registry. Its routing component resolves (tenant,
database) to VM/epoch; the gateway consults this authority and forwards requests to the hosting **VM agent
(process)**. The gateway no longer reads placement directly from Postgres. The data component view explicitly
groups the supporting control-plane registry/router separately from agent execution internals.

Every VM runs the labelled software daemon, not an AI agent. It is the sole last-mile tenant-file boundary:
all external query and lifecycle work arrives as instructions to this agent. Managed statement-lane workers,
the landed classifier, FFI execution and deadlines sit behind that boundary, with no independent external
endpoint or file authority. Container/deployment file-access edges originate at the agent; execution-component
edges explain the FFI internals. Agents provision, open/close, suspend/resume, snapshot/backup, copy
out/receive, restore and delete files, return query results, and report health, size and usage.

Topology is explicitly **n SQLite files across m VMs**. The control plane chooses each placement, but
**placement policy remains an OPEN QUESTION**. The illustrative 3/1/2 distribution demonstrates topology, not
a solved allocator. Creation publishes active placement after agent provisioning confirmation. Source and
target agents fence, drain, copy and verify moves under control-plane coordination; registry placement flips
only after target-agent readiness. Drop cleans live registry records only after agent deletion confirmation.
Stale route hints are invalidated after moves; hosting admission rejects stale epochs.

Updated the JSON diagrams, every plain/STE explanation, inventory, README dataset description and authoring
source. Diagram kinds remain context (1), container (1), component (2), dynamic (9), deployment (1):
create/query/move/drop plus the five separate provisioning, stale-route, deadline, move and drop alternatives.
The dataset still contains 44 elements, 54 relationships and 59 documents. Registration remains the existing
catalog entry; no viewer or catalog changes were needed for this addendum.

The inventory records `addendum-1.md` as a design source. Because a same-commit source cannot contain its own
commit hash, this one new source uses a clearly identified branch URL plus a SHA-256 source-byte revision. The
source test verifies that exact URL, path, dataset and file digest; all prior commit-pin checks remain intact.
The original sources retain their commit pins. The addendum source bytes are included unchanged.

Fresh desktop and 390×844 mobile captures replace the previous screenshots. Inspected the container,
control/data component and deployment canvases: Fit provides the overview; zoom/1:1 and the explanation panel
provide readable detail in large views. Mobile document width and scroll width both equal 390. The authoring
script was rerun and both generated output checksums matched, confirming reproducibility.

Learning assessment: routing authority, process boundaries and the intentionally unsolved placement policy are
preserved as inventory decisions A1–A4 within this unit's ownership. Coordinator knowledge handoff remains as
recorded above; no reusable work script was discovered. Independent design review remains a separate
coordinator step; this addendum makes no independent review verdict or main landing claim.

Validation history: initial checks caught a supporting-component scope tag, a duplicate diagram edge number,
and explicit-file formatting using different defaults; these were corrected. A generator edit briefly failed
before writing outputs and was corrected. The new source is verified by content digest for the self-reference
reason above. No existing dataset checks or acceptance expectations were removed.

| 1     | **Applied.** Lookup returns on reverse `dp-route`; authorization invokes `dp-forward` locally. Rows return agent → forwarder → authorization → ingress/client. Stale refresh now includes the gateway routing RPC before metadata access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2     | **Applied.** Explicit state/availability tables in router, admission and both move documents and inventory DP6/DP7 repair entries. Chosen policy requires online authority for each request; no offline lease/heartbeat permission. Decisions are single-use, bound to identity/epoch/generation/request and at most 30 seconds. Issuance is admission, with no prefetch. Revocation blocks subsequent decisions; fences override outstanding ones. Restart closes admission, terminates orphan workers and reconciles fences/ownership online. Commands serialize per database and durably check operation, expected epoch/generation and transition before effects/ACK. Superseded activation/unfence/delete is rejected; post-commit crashes reconcile the sole target owner. |
| 3     | **Applied.** Gateway assertions are trusted only from the authenticated service and authorize execution only, with the online authority decision. Lifecycle identity alone can issue file lifecycle commands. Transfer credentials bind operation/source/target/database/generation and expiry. Validated document CRUD/query requests generate matching IR and SQL in trusted server code; customer SQL/IR and file escape features are excluded. Contracts appear in all five requested documents and on container/agent boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4     | **Applied.** Retained bounded pools, queue count/bytes, read concurrency, per-database writer admission, handle eviction, tenant/VM aggregate budgets, fair scheduling, disk/WAL headroom, backup/move I/O reservations and reserved fence/cancel capacity. Numeric ceilings and fairness weights remain OPEN configuration, not a removal of backpressure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5     | **Applied.** Placement eligibility inputs, freshness and concurrent reservations are explicit; no eligible VM means rejection. New `cp-health` models agent → control-plane provisioner reports. Algorithm/weights and report/freshness intervals remain OPEN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6     | **Deferred.** Complete backup-publication, VM-loss recovery and replacement cleanup flows need a separate recovery design selecting storage credentials, durable manifest ownership and acceptable isolation evidence. Recorded in backup, lifecycle, control and drop plain/STE documents and inventory DP8/DP10 repair entries. RPO/RTO remain OPEN; VM loss makes every hosted database unavailable, detection is not fencing proof, no replacement writer activates without operator-verified isolation, and lost-agent cleanup stays DROPPING with its name reserved. No successful recovery/deletion is implied.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7     | **Deferred: instance companion.** Pair source/target instance move/failure views with that recovery design so transfer credentials and fencing evidence receive one review. The current node participant explicitly means a logical type; labels name A/B. Proposed bytes stream directly agent-to-agent under move-scoped credentials. **Ordering correction applied:** settle requests, checkpoint through a controlled maintenance connection, close it and remaining handles, then acknowledge quiescence and copy. Both prose variants, move step s4 and inventory match.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8     | **Applied.** Main data view reduced to ingress, authorization, authoritative lookup, local forwarder and agent admission. Related navigation links to separate `planes-agent-components` for classifier/FFI/deadlines. Comparison notes explicitly replace unspecified lanes lease/heartbeat authority with online per-request authority and retain bounded scheduling/handle budgets. Existing/mixed/planned status remains conservative. Fresh captures replace data/control/move images and add agent/mobile captures. The move capture remains a logical relationship graph, with the instance companion explicitly deferred under 7.                                                                                                                                        |

Bundle JSON, plain and STE draft documents, scenario labels and generated inventory were updated together in
`build-dataset.py`; rerun plus configured formatting reproduces both output checksums. The review is a new
commit-pinned source. No test was removed or weakened; existing generic coverage automatically includes the
new view and source. Registration remains the existing catalog entry; no catalog or viewer code edits.

Current bundle: 44 elements, 55 relationships, 60 documents; 15 diagrams: context (1), container (1),
component (3), dynamic (9), deployment (1). Flows remain create/query/move/drop and named
provisioning-failure, stale-route, deadline, move-verification-failure and drop-cleanup-failure alternatives.
Deployment remains illustrative. Deferrals add no pretend success scenarios.

Visual inspection: desktop 1920×1200 and mobile 390×844 captures checked. The data overview now separates
lookup from local dispatch and agent execution; large-view body text still needs zoom or the explanation
panel. Mobile document client width and scroll width are both 390. Source/target instance separation is not
claimed. Initial authoring checks caught an invalid component-to-component detail link (replaced by supported
related navigation) and formatting defaults (fixed with `--config deno.json`); the final checks below are the
repaired results.

Learning assessment: the repaired routing/admission/trust contracts and explicit recovery deferrals are
preserved in the inventory within ownership. Coordinator handoff: use its repair dispositions for a future
`docs/knowledge/` update; do not treat these proposed policies as landed runtime behavior. No reusable script
or new VM/environment finding was discovered. Leave this assigned worktree in place for coordinator
inspection.

Repair semantic/inventory assertions: PASS
(transport bypasses router, stale lookup RPC, five-node overview, policy tables,
plain/STE deferrals and element/relationship/step inventory coverage)
```

The assertions validate proposal consistency, not distributed runtime correctness. Pages logs are preserved
locally as `repair-pages.log` (including npm ci) and `repair-pages-final.log` (after the final wording
change).

Full root CI also completed with exit 0 (`repair-ci.log`, preserved locally):

The ignored test is the existing baseline. Final root formatting and lint were checked again after report
edits. One repair commit retains `Co-Authored-By: Codex Sol <noreply@openai.com>` and is pushed only to
`item/dp-01-planes`. This is the authorized repair, not an independent PASS verdict.
