/**
 * The logical read plan, and its **total** normalisation (plan item 09, work 2).
 *
 * This module is PURE, per the `core/` rule in `docs/adr/0001-effect-port.md`: it imports `effect`
 * and `./errors.ts`, and nothing else. Nothing in here raises; the one rejection is a
 * `CompileError` in the left channel of an `Either`.
 *
 * `normalise` is the single place two rules live that used to be spread across the tree:
 *
 * 1. **The limit rule.** `1..1000`, integer. It was duplicated in `sdk/db.ts`'s `Find.limit`
 *    (rejecting early, with a caller-facing message) and in `platform/compiler.ts`'s
 *    `compileSelect` (rejecting late, defending the SQL). `compileSelect` now gets the rule from
 *    here, so the compiler and the SDK can never drift apart on what a legal limit is.
 * 2. **Aggregates have no ordering.** `Find.count`/`Find.countBy` hand-build `order: undefined`
 *    today, and `compileSelect` separately ignores `plan.order` whenever `plan.aggregate` is set.
 *    Normalising it here makes the plan that reaches the compiler say what it means: a `count` has
 *    no row order to speak of, and a `countBy` is ordered by its grouping key, not by the caller's
 *    sort.
 *
 * Note on the type parameter order: the plan writes these signatures error-first
 * (`Either<CompileError, SelectPlan>`), but Effect 3's `Either` is value-first — `Either<A, E>`.
 * The code below uses the real Effect order, as `core/schema.ts` does.

/**
 * The intermediate representation, mirroring `sdk/db.ts`'s `Filter`/`SelectPlan` **without
 * importing them** — `core/` may not depend on `sdk/`, the same reason `core/errors.ts` mirrors
 * `sdk/functions.ts`'s `Kind` as `HandlerKind`. The two spellings are structurally identical and
 * `tests/unit/compile_test.ts` asserts their mutual assignability, so a change to one that is not
 * mirrored here fails the test run rather than drifting silently.
