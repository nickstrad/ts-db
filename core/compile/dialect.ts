/**
 * The two SQL dialects this repo generates, and the two primitives that put untrusted names and
 * strings into generated SQL safely (plan item 09).
 *
 * PURE, per the `core/` rule in `docs/adr/0001-effect-port.md`: `effect`, `../errors.ts` and
 * `../schema.ts` only. Nothing in `core/compile/` raises — item 09's acceptance criteria grep this
 * directory for raise sites and expect none — so `quote` returns an `Either` rather than rejecting
 * a bad identifier the way the pre-port `platform/compiler.ts` did. Callers that need the legacy
 * `Error` render it from the tagged error (`platform/sqlite.ts`'s `legacyError`); item 26 deleted
 * the throwing compatibility wrappers.
 *
 * Deviation from the plan's suggested layout, which has `quote` "total, no Either needed": `quote`
 * cannot be both total and identifier-checking, and dropping the check is exactly the injection bug
 * this item is meant to make impossible. So `literal` is total and `quote` is an `Either`.
