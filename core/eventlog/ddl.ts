/**
 * DDL for the append-only DuckDB event log (plan items 21 and 35, §4.1): the typed event tables, the
 * `_ingest_state` offset table and the `_eventlog_schema` version table, as pure strings.
 *
 * This module is PURE: no imports at all. `platform/eventlog/ingest.ts` runs `EVENTLOG_DDL` on every
 * connection to the persistent event-log file (`Config.eventLog.duckdbPath`), which is separate from
 * the per-app `:memory:` instances the `Reader` service opens.
 *
 * Three kinds of table, with different rules:
 *
 * - **Event tables** are append-only. Ingest only ever `INSERT`s into them; nothing in this repo
 *   rewrites or removes an event row. Losing the file loses nothing durable: the JSONL tree is the
 *   source of truth (ADR 0001 decision 4) and re-ingesting it rebuilds every table.
 * - **`_ingest_state`** is the single mutable table: one row per JSONL source file, holding how many
 *   bytes of it are ingested, the SHA-256 of exactly those bytes, and whether it was ever rewritten.
 *   `core/eventlog/offsets.ts` is the pure model of how that row evolves.
 * - **`_eventlog_schema`** records which schema version the file holds, one row per way it got there
 *   (`create`, or `rebuild-from-v1`). Rows are only ever inserted.
 *
 * `k6_points` is declared here so the schema lives in one place, but it is filled by `perf:ingest`
 * (item 25) from k6's own JSON output, not by the event-log ingest. It is not a projection of an event
 * record, so it has no `event_id`.
 *
 * ## Versions (ADR 0006)
 *
 * - **v1** (item 21) had no version table. Its typed tables had no `event_id`, and
 *   `platform_events.kind` was the record's kind except for `handler` records, where it was the
 *   handler's `query`/`mutation`.
 * - **v2** (item 35, this module): `event_id` on every typed event table; `platform_events.event_kind`
 *   (always the record's kind) and `handler_kind` replace `kind`; `http_events.kind` becomes
 *   `handler_kind`; `backup_events` gains `emitter`, `run_id` and `attempts`.
 *
 * A v2 build never reuses a v1 file's tables under the v2 mappings. `EVENTLOG_DDL` starts with two
 * guards that fail the connection — before any statement touches the file — when it holds an
 * unversioned (v1) schema, or a version this build does not know. A v1 file stays exactly as it was
 * until `upgradeEventLog` (`platform/eventlog/tables.ts`) rebuilds it from the retained JSONL and proves
 * the rebuild holds every v1 event.
