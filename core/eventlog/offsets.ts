/**
 * Pure ingest planning for the JSONL → DuckDB event log (plan item 21): given one source file's
 * bytes and its `_ingest_state` row, decide what to read, which complete lines that yields, and what
 * the row becomes. `platform/eventlog/ingest.ts` does the I/O around it; the property suite in
 * `tests/property/offsets_test.ts` drives the same functions through adversarial file histories.
 *
 * This module is PURE: no imports, no I/O. Hashing is injected (`PrefixHash`) because `core/` may
 * not import a crypto implementation.
 *
 * ## The offset model
 *
 * A source file is identified by its path relative to `LOG_DIR`. Its state row records
 * `bytesIngested` — always just past a `\n`, so it is a line boundary — and `prefixSha256`, the
 * SHA-256 of exactly bytes `[0, bytesIngested)`. On every run the planner re-hashes that prefix of
 * the file as it is now and compares:
 *
 * | file now                                   | decision                                                |
 * | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | no state row                               | `new`: read from 0                                      |
 * | size >= bytesIngested, prefix hash matches | `append`: read from `bytesIngested` (or `skip`)         |
 * | size < bytesIngested                       | `rewritten` (`truncated`): read from 0, flag for dedupe |
 * | prefix hash differs                        | `rewritten` (`prefix-mismatch`): likewise               |
 *
 * **An intact prefix is never read for ingestion again.** Only bytes past `bytesIngested` become
 * lines; the prefix is only hashed. That is what makes a second run over an unchanged tree insert
 * nothing: every file is `skip` (or ends in a partial line that is not consumed), and no row changes.
 *
 * **Only complete lines are consumed.** A read stops after the last `\n`; a trailing partial line
 * (a write in flight, or a crash mid-write) stays unconsumed until its terminator lands, so it is
 * never ingested half-written and never skipped.
 *
 * **A rewritten file is a new generation, never a loss.** The rows already inserted from it cannot
 * be removed (event tables are append-only), and the offset model cannot know which of the file's
 * current lines it has already seen. So a rewrite is read in full from byte 0 with every line
 * marked `dedupe`: the platform inserts only lines whose `eventId` is not already in
 * `platform_events`. Lines the platform cannot dedupe (malformed lines have no `eventId`) may be
 * quarantined a second time; quarantine is a diagnostic file, not an event table.
 *
 * **Once rewritten, always deduplicated.** The prefix hash vouches only for `[0, bytesIngested)`.
 * After a rewrite, the bytes past that offset can hold *old* lines: a truncation that tears off an
 * ingested line's `\n` leaves the line behind, unconsumed, until a later append restores the
 * terminator; and a second rewrite can bring back lines from an earlier generation past any offset
 * the row could record. So a detected rewrite sets the row's `dedupe` flag, and every line read from
 * that file afterwards — in this run and every later `append` — is deduplicated on `eventId`. The
 * flag is never cleared: the offset model can no longer vouch for that path. It costs one anti-join
 * per batch, and only for files something outside the platform rewrote; the platform's own writers
 * only append. (The plan's §4.1 `_ingest_state` had no such column; the property suite found the
 * double inserts without it — first a torn terminator, then a byte horizon defeated by a second
 * rewrite.)
 *
 * The threat model is the one the log writers actually present: append-only files written in
 * whole lines, plus truncation, rewrite, or delete-and-recreate by something outside the platform.
 * Out of model, and not deduplicated: a line *moved* into a file that was never rewritten (it is a
 * new line of that file), and an outside append that duplicates lines while keeping the ingested
 * prefix intact (`cat f f > f` reads as an ordinary append). Both are duplicate *production*, which
 * offsets cannot tell from new events.
 *
 * Cost: the prefix is re-hashed on every run, so a run reads every `.jsonl` file in full. Retention
 * gzips dated directories after `gzipAfterDays` (default 2), and `.gz` files are not ingested, so the
 * hashed set is bounded by a few days of logs. A windowed hash would be cheaper and would miss
 * truncate-and-regrow rewrites inside the window; exactness was chosen over speed.
