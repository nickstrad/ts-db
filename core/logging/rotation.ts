/**
 * Pure rotation and retention policy for the JSONL event log (plan item 06).
 *
 * This module is PURE: no platform globals, no built-in runtime modules, no filesystem access. It
 * only computes paths and plans against a policy; the risky part — actually gzipping or deleting
 * files on disk — is left to the sweeper that executes a `RetentionPlan`
 * (`platform/logging/retention.ts`). Item 36 adds the gate that sweeper applies first:
 * `retentionBlock` decides, from facts the sweeper gathered, whether a file is closed, settled and
 * fully accounted for by committed ingest, and `plan`'s `pinned` set keeps every file that is not.
 *
 * On-disk layout (see docs/plans/effect-port-and-observability.md §4.2):
 *   logs/<role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/events-<HH>-<pid>-<seq>.jsonl
 * `role` is one of the four known roles. `YYYY-MM-DD` and `HH` are the local calendar date and
 * hour at the moment the file was opened (local time, not UTC — logs should read in the operator's
 * wall clock). `seq` is zero-padded to 3 digits, matching the plan's worked example.
 * A gzipped file stays in its dated directory and gains a `.gz` suffix:
 *   logs/<role>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/events-<HH>-<pid>-<seq>.jsonl.gz

 * gzipped once they are `gzipAfterDays` old or more (and not yet due for deletion), and otherwise
 * kept. A path already ending in `.gz` was compressed by an earlier sweep and is gzip-ineligible:
 * it falls through to `keep`, while its bytes still count toward `maxTotalBytes` and it remains
 * eligible for age-based `delete`. If the bytes still on disk (kept + gzip-pending) exceed
 * `maxTotalBytes`, whole non-today directories are moved to `delete` oldest-first — overriding any
 * gzip decision for that directory — until the total is back under the cap or only today's
 * directory remains.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running `plan` with the same `now` against the post-plan file set — `delete`
 * paths gone, each `gzip` source replaced in place by `<path>.gz` per §4.2's on-disk layout —
 * yields an empty `gzip` and `delete`. See `tests/unit/rotation_test.ts`'s idempotency case.
 *
 * `pinned` (item 36) names paths that must stay exactly as they are whatever their age: files the
 * sweeper could not prove safe to touch (open, unsettled, not fully ingested — see
 * `retentionBlock`). A pinned file is always in `keep`, and its bytes still count toward
 * `maxTotalBytes` because they are still on disk. The cap therefore keeps pruning *other* old files,
 * oldest directory first, until the total fits or nothing unpinned outside today is left; pinned
 * bytes that keep the total over the cap are the caller's unsafe backlog to report, never a reason
 * to touch them. With no pins this is exactly the item-06 policy.
 *
 * Throws `InvalidDateBucketError` if any entry's `dir` is not a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` date bucket.

 * - `unsettled`: modified less than `settleMs` before `now` (or in the future): a write that began
 *   before its hour ended may still be landing.
 * - `changed`: it is no longer the file the inventory saw (size, mtime or inode).
 * - `unreadable`: its content could not be read (or, for `.gz`, decompressed) to prove anything.
 * - `no-watermark`: ingest has never committed an offset for it.
 * - `unread-tail`: the committed offset stops short of the end — unread lines or a partial tail.
 * - `watermark-mismatch`: the committed offset is past the end, or the content is not the bytes
 *   that ingest committed (a rewrite since).
 * - `unreconciled`: the derived store and the quarantine do not account for every record exactly.
 * - `quarantine-evidence`: a `rejected.jsonl` some retained source's rejects still live in.
